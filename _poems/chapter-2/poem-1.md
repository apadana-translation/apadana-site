# The Legend of the Lonely Buddhas

Now listen to the legend of the Lonely Buddhas:

The Sage of Vedeha,[^1] his body bent,  
asked the Thus-Gone-One dwelling in Jetavana,  
“Indeed there are those \[called\] the Lonely Buddhas;[^2]  
through what causes do they become \[so\], Wise One?” (1) \[82\][^3]

Then spoke the Omniscient, Outstanding, Great Sage,  
to lucky Ānanda with \[his\] honeyed voice,  
“Who performed service among former[^4] Buddhas,  
\[but\] didn’t get freed in those Victors’ teachings,[^5] (2) \[83\]

because that’s the means to awaken, the Wise,  
because of \[their\] wishes \[and\] also great strength,  
through knowledge and power, those with sharp knowing  
reach the Awakening of Lonely \[Buddhas\]. (3) \[84\]

In every world, with the exception of me,  
there is no equal for the Lonely Buddhas.  
I will describe a piece of the excellent  
character[^6] of those Buddhas, the Great Sages. (4) \[85\]

All of you, with well-pleased minds,[^7] aspiring for  
the unsurpassed medicine, hear, by yourselves,  
the excellent sayings, which are short and sweet,[^8]  
of those Great Sages who were Lonely Buddhas, (5) \[86\]

which are explanations of generations  
of Lonely Buddhas who gathered together,  
and a story of dispassion for danger[^9]  
and likewise \[how\] they achieved Awakening. (6) \[87\]

With awareness detached from passionate things,  
mind not delighting in delights in the world,  
abandoning obstacles, throbbing conquered,  
thereby indeed[^10] they achieved Awakening. (7) \[88\]

Putting away the stick among all beings,  
not causing harm to a single one of them,  
with a loving mind, friendly, compassionate,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (8) \[89\][^11]

Putting away the stick among all beings,  
not causing harm to a single one of them,  
not wishing for sons, let alone[^12] companions,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (9) \[90\][^13]

Affections arise for one with connections;  
this dis-ease proceeds in line with affections.  
Seeing the danger that’s born of affections,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (10) \[91\][^14]

Feeling compassion for friends \[and\] companions,  
one puts off the goal, mind tied \[to their problems\];  
seeing that fearfulness in intimacy,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (11) \[92\][^15]

One who is attentive to sons and to wives  
is entangled like a large bamboo \[thicket\].  
Not stuck to others, like a new bamboo shoot,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (12) \[93\][^16]

Just as a deer, not ensnared, goes for pasture  
in the forest according to \[its\] wishes,  
a knowing man looks after independence;  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (13) \[94\][^17]

Resting, standing, going, wandering there is  
\[some\] invitation amidst \[one’s\] companions.  
Looking after independence \[most\] don’t want,[^18]  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (14) \[95\][^19]

Amidst \[one’s\] companions there is delighting  
in sports, and there is abundant love for sons.  
\[Though\] hating separation from what’s held dear,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (15) \[96\][^20]

Global in outlook,[^21] one is causing no harm,  
being happy with whatever comes one’s way;  
an endurer of troubles, not stiff with fear,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (16) \[97\][^22]

Even some who have gone forth are ill-disposed;  
likewise \[some\] householders living in the house.  
Being unconcerned about others’ children,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (17) \[98\][^23]

Shedding the attributes of life in the house  
like an ebony[^24] tree whose leaves have fallen,  
the hero severs the ties to household life;  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (18) \[99\][^25]

If one should obtain a clever companion,  
a co-wanderer who lives well \[and\] is wise,  
after having overcome every trouble  
one would wander with that one, thrilled \[and\] mindful. (19) \[100\][^26]

If one should not get a clever companion,  
a co-wanderer who lives well \[and\] is wise,  
\[then\] like a king quitting a conquered kingdom  
one should wander alone, like tuskers in the woods.[^27] (20) \[101\][^28]

Truly we’re praising success with companions;  
those[^29] who are better or equal should be served.  
Not getting those, not enjoying sinful things,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (21) \[102\][^30]

Seeing shiny \[bangles made out\] of \[fine\] gold,  
which have been well-made by the son of a smith,  
banging together when two are on \[one\] arm  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (22) \[103\][^31]

“Like that, with another,[^32] there will be for me,  
meaningless chatter or ill-tempered \[bad speech\];”  
seeing that as a danger for the future,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (23) \[104\][^33]

Sense pleasures are varied, sweet and delightful;  
\[they\] churn up the mind with \[their\] varying form.  
Seeing danger in the strands of sense pleasure,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (24) \[105\][^34]

“For me this is calamity, misfortune;  
a sickness, a \[sharp\] arrow, a fearsome thing.”  
Seeing this fear in the strands of sense pleasure,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (25) \[106\][^35]

\[Freezing\] cold and \[scorching\] heat, hunger and thirst,  
wind \[and\] hot weather and gadflies \[and\] serpents:  
having vanquished even all of those \[problems\]  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (26) \[107\][^36]

Just as a noble elephant with a full-  
grown spotted body, abandoning the herd,  
might dwell in the woods, however it wishes,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (27) \[108\][^37]

“One who is fond of company cannot touch[^38]  
liberation, even temporarily.”  
Heeding with care \[those\] words of the Sun’s Kinsman,[^39]  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (28) \[109\][^40]

Freed from \[incessant\] wrangling of opinions,  
gaining the way, getting the path, \[with the thought,\]  
“I know I am not to be led by others,”  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (29) \[110\][^41]

Freed from greed, without deceit, \[and\] thirst-free,  
lacking hypocrisy, fault- and folly-free,[^42]  
becoming intention-free in the whole world,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (30) \[111\][^43]

Avoiding, not consorting with an evil  
companion, who is blind[^44] to the goal, who gets  
into trouble, who intends \[things\], is slothful,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (31) \[112\][^45]

One should consort with \[someone\] noble, a friend,  
very learned, *Dhamma*-bearer, skilled preacher.  
Discerning \[one’s own\] goals, removing \[all\] doubt,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (32) \[113\][^46]

Not embellishing, not looking after sport  
nor[^47] delights, pleasures, happiness in the world;  
abstaining from adornment,[^48] telling the truth,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (33) \[114\][^49]

Having given up sense pleasures completely,  
\[including\] sons and wives, father \[and\] mother,  
wealth and grain and also \[all one’s\] relatives  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (34) \[115\][^50]

Mindful, discerning, “this is an attachment;  
the happiness here is trifling, little fun;  
here there is much suffering, this is a shaft,”[^51]  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (35) \[116\][^52]

Having broken to bits \[one’s own\] hindrances,[^53]  
like a fish breaking a net in the water,  
like fire that does not return to what is burnt,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (36) \[117\][^54]

With eyes cast downward, not \[just\] goofing around,  
having senses guarded and mind protected,  
not filled with desire,[^55] not burning \[as though fire,\]  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (37) \[118\][^56]

Discarding the attributes of household life,  
just like a coral tree[^57] with fallen-off leaves,  
departing \[the house\] wearing the saffron robe,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (38) \[119\][^58]

Not[^59] greedy for \[good\] tastes, not wavering, not  
feeding others, on unbroken begging rounds,[^60]  
with a mind that’s not bound to this clan or that,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (39) \[120\][^61]

Abandoning the five hindrances of mind,  
having pushed away all of the defilements,  
independent, affection \[and\] hate removed,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (40) \[121\][^62]

Putting happiness and suffering behind,  
\[and\] even in the past, mental joy and pain;[^63]  
attaining equanimity, calm and pure,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (41) \[122\][^64]

With strenuous effort[^65] to reach the best goal,  
with mind unstuck \[and\] behavior attentive,  
with firm exertion, having strength and power,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (42) \[123\][^66]

Not quitting solitude \[or\] meditation,  
among things always living by the Teaching,  
grasping the danger within existences,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (43) \[124\][^67]

Aspiring to destroy craving, not lazy,  
not foolish, learned, possessing mindfulness,  
probing the Teaching, restrained, energetic,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (44) \[125\][^68]

Not terrified, like a lion \[hearing\] sounds;  
unentangled, as is the wind in a net;  
not smeared, like a pink lotus by the water,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (45) \[126\][^69]

Having overcome, like a strong-toothed lion,  
the king of beasts, wandering victorious,  
one should make use of lodgings that are remote,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (46) \[127\][^70]

Practicing love, equanimity, pity,  
release, or[^71] joy for others at the \[right\] time,  
being unobstructed by the entire world,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (47) \[128\][^72]

Quitting passion and hatred and delusion,  
having broken to bits \[one’s own\] hindrances,[^73]  
not trembling at the moment when life’s destroyed,  
one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (48) \[129\][^74]

They associate, they embrace with \[some\] motive;  
friends without motives are hard to find[^75] these days.  
Wise about self-interest, people aren’t pure.  
One should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn. (49) \[130\][^76]

With Pure Morals and With Very Pure Wisdom,  
Attentive, Applying Selves to Mindfulness,  
Insightful, Seeing the Teaching’s Distinction,  
knowing the aspects of path \[and\] of wisdom,[^77] (50) \[131\]

in a Victor’s dispensation practicing  
merit, aspiration \[and\] thus \[gaining\] signs,[^78]  
Wise Ones who don’t go on to have followers  
become Lonely Victors, \[those\] Self-Become Ones. (51) \[132\]

With Vast *Dhamma,*[^79] \[and\] Many *Dhamma*-Bodies,[^80]  
Mind-Lords,[^81] Crossing the Flood of All Suffering,[^82]  
With Thrilled Minds,[^83] Seers of the Ultimate Goal,[^84]  
Analogues of Lions,[^85] Like a Rhino’s Horn,[^86] (52) \[133\]

With Tranquil Senses,[^87] With Tranquil Minds,[^88] Composed,[^89]  
Acting Mindfully[^90] for[^91] neighboring beings,[^92]  
Lamps[^93] shining the light of ultimate truth here,  
these Lonely Buddhas are constantly honored.[^94] (53) \[134\]

All Obstacles Abandoned,[^95] Lords of People,[^96]  
Lamps of the World,[^97] Shedding Light Like Heaps of Gold,[^98]  
Free of Doubt \[and\] Good for the World to Look At,[^99]  
these Lonely Buddhas are constantly honored.[^100] (54) \[135\]

The clever sayings[^101] of the Lonely Buddhas  
are circulating[^102] in the world with \[its\] gods.  
Having heard, those who don’t act that way are fools;  
they spin in suffering again and again. (55) \[136\]

The clever sayings[^103] of the Lonely Buddhas  
are as sweet as if they were[^104] flowing honey.[^105]  
Having heard, those who practice accordingly  
become seers of the \[Four\][^106] Truths, very wise. (56) \[137\]

The\[se\] lofty verses spoken by \[those\] Victors,  
Lonely Buddhas, gone forth into homelessness,  
were made known, for apprehending the Teaching,  
by the Śākyan Lion,[^107] the Ultimate Man. (57) \[138\]

With pity for the world, these transformations[^108]  
of those \[Self-Become Ones,\] the Lonely Buddhas,  
were made known by \[him,\] the Self-Become Lion,  
for increasing emotion and connection.[^109] (58) \[139\]

The Legend of the Lonely Buddhas is finished.[^110]

[^1]: the Sage of Videha is Ānanda, the Buddha’s cousin and personal attendant.

[^2]: *paccekabuddhā*

[^3]: This and the following two verses correspond to the first three verses of *Buddhāpadāna,* above, where they are however found only in the BJTS edition; here, PTS agrees with BJTS in including them. They are in the more elaborate meter, with eleven syllables per foot, that characterizes the entire *Paccekabuddhāpadāna* (and the *sutta* from which it in turn draws, SN I.3), so I have translated accordingly.

[^4]: reading *pubba°* with BJTS (and PTS alt., and BJTS \[2\], above) for PTS *sabba°* (“all”)

[^5]: or “dispensations:” *°sāsanesu*

[^6]: *vaṇṇa-padesa-mattaŋ*

[^7]: or, reading *sabbesu pasannacittā,* “with minds pleased in all of those \[Lonely Buddhas\]”

[^8]: or read *madhuṃ va khuddaṃ* (“sweet like honey”) with BJTS, as below even in PTS (v. 56)?

[^9]: *ādīnavo yañ ca*, BJTS Sinhala gloss *kāmayen*, i.e., “the danger” is (as *ādīnavo* connotes) passion itself.

[^10]: reading *tath’ eva* with BJTS for PTS *tatth’ eva* (“there indeed”)

[^11]: BJTS adds the Pāli note: *ayaṃ gāthā marammapothake ca suttanipāte ca na vijjjati,* “this verse is not found in the Burmese edition nor \[lit., “and”\] in *Suttanipāta*,” referring to the remarkable fact that even though the following text is lifted almost verbatim from the “Rhinocerous Horn” *sutta* of the *Sutta-nipāta* (I.3), corresponding as indicated in the footnotes on the following verses, this present verse in the *Paccekabuddhāpadāna*, though it follows the format of the *Sutta-nipāta sutta*, is not found in that *sutta* (nor, apparently, in Burmese manuscripts of *Apadāna*).

[^12]: *kuto*, lit., “how then?” “from where?”

[^13]: This is SN, v. 35

[^14]: = SN, v. 36

[^15]: = SN, v. 37

[^16]: = SN, v. 38

[^17]: = SN, v. 39

[^18]: *anabhijjhitaŋ seritaŋ*, lit., “un-coveted independence”

[^19]: = SN, v. 40

[^20]: = SN, v. 41

[^21]: *catuddiso*, lit., “\[one who belongs to\] the four directions”

[^22]: = SN, v. 42

[^23]: = SN, v. 43

[^24]: *koviḷāra*, species of ebony, Bauhinia variegata

[^25]: = SN, v. 44

[^26]: = SN, v. 45

[^27]: lit., “like a *mātaṅga* elephant in the woods (or forest)”

[^28]: This corresponds to SN, v. 46 but the latter does not diverge from the standard refrain, reading as the fourth foot: “one should wander alone, like a rhino’s horn.”

[^29]: lit., “companions”

[^30]: = SN, v. 47

[^31]: = SN, v. 48. Clanging bangles is a common image of the throes of passion in Sanskrit erotic poetry, one of many levels at which the imagery here works to characterize the Lonely Buddha’s aversion to the world

[^32]: *dutiyena sahā,* lit., “with a second”

[^33]: = SN, v. 49

[^34]: = SN, v. 50

[^35]: = SN, v. 51

[^36]: = SN, v. 52

[^37]: = SN, v. 53

[^38]: lit., “it is an impossibility (*aṭṭhāna*, for *a-ṭṭhānaṃ*, lit., “groundless”) that one...would touch”

[^39]: *Ādiccabandhussa.* Though elsewhere in *Apadāna* this epithet signals Sammāsambuddhas (especially Tissa), here, as BJTS gloss makes clear, it refers to the Paccekabuddha to whom the phrase in quotation marks is attributed.

[^40]: = SN, v. 54

[^41]: = SN, v. 55

[^42]: *niddhanta-kasāva=moho*, lit., “with faults and delusions blown away/purified/cleaned up”

[^43]: = SN, v. 56

[^44]: lit., “who does not see” “who does not look at”

[^45]: = SN, v. 57

[^46]: = SN, v. 58

[^47]: *ca,* lit., “and”

[^48]: *vibhūsanaṭṭhāṇā,* lit., “from a state of adornment”. The *°(ṭ)ṭhāṇā* here is largely superfluous, except in providing the ablative required by *virato,* and messes up the meter (13 syllables in this foot), but neither PTS nor BJTS indicates any hesitation about the reading. Norman, in his SN tr. (p. 9) reads *vibhūsanā* and omits *°ṭṭhāṇā*

[^49]: = SN, v. 59

[^50]: = SN, v. 60

[^51]: *kaṇḍo*, the shaft of an arrow (also an arrow itself, and “lump”)

[^52]: = SN, v. 61

[^53]: or “fetters,” *saŋyojanāni*

[^54]: = SN, v. 62

[^55]: *anavassuto*, lit., “not leaking” “not oozing”

[^56]: = SN, v. 63

[^57]: *pārichatto*, RD: Erythmia Indica, also a tree in Indra’s heaven

[^58]: = SN, v. 64

[^59]: *akaraŋ*, lit., “not doing”

[^60]: *sapadānacārī*

[^61]: = SN, v. 65

[^62]: = SN, v. 66

[^63]: *pubbe va somanassaŋ domanassaŋ,* KRN SN tr. “already”

[^64]: = SN, v. 67

[^65]: *āraddhaviriyo*

[^66]: = SN, v. 68

[^67]: = SN, v. 69

[^68]: = SN, v. 70

[^69]: = SN, v. 71

[^70]: = SN, v. 72

[^71]: *ca*, lit., “and”

[^72]: = SN, v. 73

[^73]: or “fetters,” *saŋyojanāni*

[^74]: = SN, v. 74

[^75]: or “hard to get,” *dullabhā*

[^76]: = SN, v. 75. This is the concluding verse of this sermon in SN, and the remaining verses of this *apadāna* are apparently unique to it.

[^77]: lit., “of going in the aspects of path \[and\] the aspects of wisdom (*°bojjhaṅga°*)”

[^78]: or predictions: *nimittaŋ*

[^79]: *mahantadhammā*

[^80]: *bahudhammakāyā*

[^81]: *cittissarā*

[^82]: *sabbadukkhoghatiṇṇā*

[^83]: *udaggacittā*

[^84]: *paramatthadassī*

[^85]: *sīhopamā*, lit., “with lions as metaphors”

[^86]: *khaggavisāṇakappā*

[^87]: *santindriyā*

[^88]: *santamānā*

[^89]: *samādhī*

[^90]: *satippacārā*

[^91]: lit., “in” “among”

[^92]: *paccantasattesu satippacārā*. BJTS reads *paccanta gambhīra-mata-ppacāra*, “Going About with Deep Thought for Neighboring \[Folks\]” (?)

[^93]: *Dīpā*

[^94]: reading *satataccitā ‘me* with BJTS for PTS *satataŋ hitā ‘me* (“these...who are constantly friendly”)

[^95]: *pahīnasabbāvaraṇā*

[^96]: *janindā*

[^97]: *lokappadīpā*

[^98]: *ghanakañcanābhā*

[^99]: *lokasudakkhiṇeyyā*

[^100]: reading *satataccitā ‘me* with BJTS for PTS *satataŋ hitā ‘me* (“these...who are constantly friendly”)

[^101]: *subhāsitāni*

[^102]: *caranti*

[^103]: *subhāsitāni*

[^104]: lit., “like”

[^105]: BJTS reads *khuddam avassavantaṃ* (“flowing honey”) for PTS *khuddam iva ssavantam* (“like \[“as if they were”\] flowing honey”)*, *

[^106]: I follow BJTS Sinhala gloss in interpolating “the Four Noble Truths” here, as elsewhere more explicitly throughout *Apadāna*.

[^107]: *Śākyasīhena*

[^108]: *vikubbitāni*, lit., “miraculous transformations” (as through *iddhi* superpowers); the terms seems to agree with *subhāsitāni*, “clever sayings,” in vv. 55-56 = “lofty verses” in v. 57.

[^109]: *saŋvegasaṅgāmativaḍḍhanatthaŋ*

[^110]: PTS (only) adds “the second”.
