### \[30. Eighteen Thousand Buddhist Nuns Headed Up by Yasodharā[^1]\]

Buddhist nuns, eighteen thousand \[strong,\]  
\[who were\] born in the Śākyan \[clan\],  
headed up by Yasodharā,  
went up to \[him,\] the Sambuddha. (1) \[1044\]

All those eighteen thousand women  
are superpower-possessors.  
Worshipping the feet of the Sage,  
they’re announcing their strength’s extent. (2) \[1045\]

"Birth is destroyed, old age, disease,  
and death is \[as well,\] O Great Sage;  
Guide, we travel the peaceful path,  
deathless and without defilement. (3) \[1046\]

If there’s trouble in the city,  
even for everyone, Great Sage,  
they \[all\] know \[our\] imperfections;  
Leader, \[give us your\] forgive\[ness\].” (4) \[1047\]

"\[Now\] display \[your\] superpowers,  
doers of my dispensation;  
to that extent cut off the doubt  
among all of the assemblies.” (5) \[1048\]

"We’re Yasodharās, Great Hero;  
desirable, speaking sweet words.  
\[And\] in the home, O Great Hero,  
\[we\] all \[were fixed as\] your chief queens.[^2] (6) \[1049\]

In your household, O Hero, we  
were the leaders, the lords of all  
of the \[women there, who numbered\]  
one hundred thousand ninety six. (7) \[1050\]

\[All us women are\] endowed with  
the virtues of beauty and grace;  
youthful, well-spoken, we’re revered,  
like gods[^3] \[are revered by\] people. (8) \[1051\]

All \[us\] eighteen thousand \[women,\]  
born in the clan of the Śākyas,  
are famous ones,[^4] \[Yasodharās,\]  
the leaders of thousands back then. (9) \[1052\]

Beyond the essence of desire,  
fixed as the essence of beauty,  
\[we’re\] unmatched in terms of beauty  
among \[other\] thousands, Great Sage.” (10) \[1053\]

Worshipping[^5] the Sambuddha, they  
showed the Teacher superpowers.[^6]  
They displayed great superpowers,  
diverse, having various forms. (11) \[1054\]

Body big as the universe,[^7]  
they \[made\] the continent[^8] up north  
\[their\] head\[s\]; both other islands wings;  
\[and made\] India \[their\] torso\[s\]; (12) \[1055\]

tail feathers: the southern ocean;  
\[other\] feathers: varied rivers;  
\[their\] eyes were the moon and the sun,  
\[their\] crests \[were\] cosmic Mount Meru. (13) \[1056\]

\[In their\] beak\[s\], mountain at world’s end,[^9]  
\[they carried\] a tree[^10] with its roots.  
Coming up to \[him,\] fanning \[him,\]  
they’re worshipping the World’s Leader. (14) \[1057\]

\[Then\] they made themselves[^11] elephants,  
likewise horses, mountains, oceans,  
the moon and the sun, Mount Meru,  
and Śakra, \[the king of the gods\]. (15) \[1058\]

"We’re like Yasodharās,[^12] Hero;  
We worship \[your\] feet, Eyeful One.  
Through your majesty, Hero,  
we’re perfected, Leader of Men. (16) \[1059\]

We’ve mastered the superpowers  
\[like\] the “divine ear” element.  
We’re also the masters, Great Sage,  
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (17) \[1060\]

We remember \[our\] former lives;  
\[our\] “divine eye\[s\]” are purified.  
All the defilements are destroyed;  
\[we\] will not be reborn again. (18) \[1061\]

In meaning and in the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
\[this\] knowledge of ours was produced  
in your presence, O Great Hero.[^13] (19) \[1062\]

Our meeting with \[all\] the Buddhas,[^14]  
the World-Lords, was displayed \[to you\];  
our extensive service \[to them\]  
was for the sake of you, Great Sage. (20) \[1063\]

O Sage, recall the good karma,  
which formerly \[was done\] by us;  
\[that\] merit was heaped up by us  
for the sake of you, Great Hero. (21) \[1064\]

We kept from misconduct, hindered[^15]  
the \[nine\] impossible places;[^16]  
we have sacrificed[^17] life \[itself\]  
for the sake of you, Great Hero. (22) \[1065\]

We were given to be \[your\] wives,  
several tens of billions \[of times\].  
We were not distressed about that,  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. (23) \[1066\]

We were given to do service,  
several tens of billions \[of times\].  
We were not distressed about that,  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. (24) \[1067\]

We were given to \[provide\] food,  
several tens of billions \[of times\].  
We were not distressed about that,  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. (25) \[1068\]

We have given you \[all our\] lives,  
several tens of billions \[of times\].  
We’ll liberate \[ourselves\] from fear,  
giving up our lives \[once more\]. (26) \[1069\]

Great Sage for your sake we do not[^18]  
conceal the things of a woman,  
numerous clothes of varied types,  
ornaments affixed to[^19] \[our\] limbs. (27) \[1070\]

Wealth and grain have been given up,  
villages and also small towns,  
fields and sons and daughters \[as well\]  
have been given up, O Great Sage. (28) \[1071\]

Elephants, horses, also cows,  
slaves \[as well as\] servant-women  
are given up beyond all count,  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. (29) \[1072\]

Whatever we are told \[to give\]  
as alms to beggars, we give \[that\];  
we don’t witness[^20] any distress  
from giving the ultimate gift. (30) \[1073\]

\[We have\] experienced[^21] dis-ease  
of diverse types, beyond all count,  
in \[this\] much-varied existence[^22]  
for the sake of you, Great Hero. (31) \[1074\]

Attaining comfort\[s,\] we don’t thrill;  
\[We do\]n’t get distressed by[^23] troubles.  
Everywhere we remain balanced  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. (32) \[1075\]

After experiencing \[both\]  
pleasure \[and\] pain along the way,  
the Great Sage reached Awakening,  
the Teaching for which[^24] Buddha[^25] strived. (33) \[1076\]

By you \[and\] by us there was much  
meeting with the other World-Lords,  
\[whether you’re\] the god Brahmā or[^26]  
Gotama Buddha,[^27] World’s Leader. (34) \[1077\]

We performed a lot of service,  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage;  
while you sought the Buddha's Teaching,[^28]  
we were \[always\] your attendants. (35) \[1078\]

One hundred thousand aeons \[and\]  
four incalculable \[aeons\]  
hence, Dīpaṅkara, Great Hero,  
the Leader of the World was born. (36) \[1079\]

\[Some\]place in a nearby country,  
inviting \[him,\] the Thus-Gone-One,  
happy-minded folks are cleaning  
the road \[on which\] he is coming. (37) \[1080\]

At that time there was a brahmin,  
\[known by\] the name of Sumedha.  
He was making the road ready  
for the All-Seer who was coming. (38) \[1081\]

At that time we all were maidens,  
who had been born in brahmin \[clans\];  
we carried to that assembly  
flowers grown in water, on land.[^29] (39) \[1082\]

Just then the Greatly Famed Buddha,  
Dīpaṅkara, the Great Hero,  
prophesied[^30] \[future Buddhahood\]  
\[for that\] sage with a lofty mind. (40) \[1083\]

The earth together with \[its\] gods  
was shaking, roaring \[and\] quaking,  
as he was praising his karma  
\[for that\] sage with a lofty mind. (41) \[1084\]

Divine maidens, human women,  
we and the \[whole world\] with \[its\] gods,  
worshipping[^31] with various things  
to be offered,[^32] we made wishes. (42) \[1085\]

The Buddha with the name “Bright Lamp”  
prophesied to them \[at that time:\]  
“Who wished today, they’re going to be,  
\[reborn together,\] face-to-face.” (43) \[1086\]

Rejoicing about \[Buddha’s\] speech,  
we lived behaving in that way  
the Buddha prophesied for us  
numberless aeons ago. (44) \[1087\]

We brought pleasure to \[our\] mind\[s\] when  
that karma was well done \[by us\];  
we experienced countless wombs,  
divine \[as well as\] human \[ones\]. (45) \[1088\]

Undergoing pleasure \[and\] pain,  
among gods \[and\] human beings,  
when \[our\] last rebirth was attained,  
we were born in the Śākyan clan. (46) \[1089\]

Beautiful and very wealthy,  
famous and likewise virtuous;  
endowed with every attainment,  
we’re much-honored among the clans. (47) \[1090\]

Riches, fame, hospitality,  
\[and\] indulgence in worldly things –  
\[they\] do not agitate \[our\] minds;[^33]  
we have no fear from anything. (48) \[1091\]

We were appointed to attend  
on what the Blessed One had said  
within the harem of the king  
in the kṣatriyan city then. (49) \[1092\]

\[We are\] women who are servants,  
and \[those\] who feel pleasure and pain,  
and women who declare the facts,  
women who are compassionate. (50) \[1093\]

Well-practiced, the Teaching-practice;  
that practice is not ill-practiced.  
\[We’re\] at ease practicing Teaching,  
in this world and in the other. (51) \[1094\]

After abandoning the home,  
going[^34] forth into homelessness,  
when eight months[^35] had not yet elapsed,  
we attained the Four \[Noble\] Truths. (52) \[1095\]

Like the waves upon the ocean,  
\[folks\] are bringing many varied[^36]  
monastic robes and alms to eat,  
requisites \[as well as\] lodgings. (53) \[1096\]

Our defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
we are living without constraint. (54) \[1097\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for us.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[we have\] done what the Buddha taught! (55) \[1098\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[we have\] done what the Buddha taught! (56) \[1099\]

Thus many sorts of suffering  
and many types of happiness;  
the pure life \[now\] has been achieved,  
we have obtained all achievements. (57) \[1100\]

Woman who are giving themselves  
for the merit of the Great Sage  
attain companionship \[with him\],[^37]  
\[and\] unconditioned nirvana.[^38] (58) \[1101\]

The past is thoroughly destroyed,  
and the present \[and\] the future;  
all of[^39] our karma is destroyed:  
we[^40] worship your feet, Eyeful One.” (59) \[1102\]

“What more can I say to women  
who are going[^41] to nirvana?  
Pacifying conditioned flaws[^42]  
you should attain the deathless state.” (60) \[1103\]

Thus indeed Eighteen Thousand Buddhist Nuns Headed Up by Yasodharā spoke these verses.
