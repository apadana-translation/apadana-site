### \[9. Pañcadīpikā[^1]\]

In the city, Haṃsavatī,  
I was a wanderer back then.  
From hermitage to hermitage,  
I wandered desiring the good.[^2] (1) \[91\]

One day when the moon was waning,[^3]  
I saw the supreme Bodhi \[Tree\].  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart there,  
I sat down at that Bodhi’s roots. (2) \[92\]

Standing with a heart of reverence,  
hands pressed together on \[my\] head,  
knowing mental happiness \[there,\]  
I then reflected in this way: (3) \[93\]

“If \[he\] has limitless virtue,  
is unique, without a rival,  
let Buddha show me a marvel;  
let him make this Bodhi \[Tree\] shine.” (4) \[94\]

When I made that aspiration,  
the Bodhi Tree did then blaze up.  
It shined forth in all directions,  
displaying[^4] every good color.[^5] (5) \[95\]

Seven nights and days I sat there,  
at the roots of that Bodhi \[Tree\],  
\[and\] when the seventh day arrived,  
I made an offering[^6] of lamps. (6) \[96\]

Setting them around my seat \[there,\]  
I \[proceeded to\] light five lamps.  
\[And\] then my lamps \[all remained\] lit,  
until the sun did rise \[again\]. (7) \[97\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (8) \[98\]

There my well-made divine mansion  
was known as “Pañcadīpī”[^7] then.  
It was a hundred leagues in height,  
\[and\] sixty leagues in width back then.[^8] (9) \[99\]

Uncountable numbers of lamps  
are burning in my surroundings.  
The divine world is \[then\] lit up  
with lamp-light, up to its edges.[^9] (10) \[100\]

If when standing looking eastward,  
I should desire to see \[something\],  
above, below, also across,  
I see everything with \[my\] eyes. (11) \[101\]

As far as I should wish to see,[^10]  
things well done and things not well done,[^11]  
there’s no obstruction \[to my sight\]  
in the trees and the mountains there. (12) \[102\]

I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of eighty kings among the gods.  
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of one hundred wheel-turning kings. (13) \[103\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
in my surroundings, a \[whole\] lakh  
of lamps are burning \[there\] for me. (14) \[104\]

Fallen from the world of the gods,  
being born in a mother’s womb,  
while I was in that mother’s womb,  
my eyes were open all the time.[^12] (15) \[105\]

Due to my having good karma,[^13]  
an \[entire\] hundred thousand lamps  
are lit in the lying-in room:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] five lamps. (16) \[106\]

When my final rebirth occurred,  
I turned \[my\] mind away \[from lust\].  
I attained the unaging \[and\]  
undying cool state, nirvana. (17) \[107\]

\[When\] I was \[but\] seven years old,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.  
Discerning \[my\] virtue, Buddha  
Gotama ordained \[me right then\]. (18) \[108\]

Meditating on a platform,[^14]  
beneath a tree, in palaces,  
in caves or empty buildings \[then\]  
five lamps are burning \[there\] for me. (19) \[109\]

My divine eye is purified;  
I am skilled in concentration.  
I excel in special knowledges:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] five lamps. (20) \[110\]

Every achievement is achieved;  
\[my\] duty’s done, \[I’m\] undefiled.  
With five lamps I’m worshipping \[your\]  
feet, Great Hero, o Eyeful One. (21) \[111\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave \[him\] those lamps back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] five lamps. (22) \[112\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (23) \[113\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (24) \[114\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (25) \[115\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Pañcadīpikā spoke these verses.

The legend of Pañcadīpikā Therī is finished.

[^1]: “Five-Lamp-er”

[^2]: lit., “for the sake of wholesome \[karma\].”

[^3]: *kālapakkhamhi divase*, lit., “on a day in the waning-moon \[half of the month\],” perhaps to be taken as the moonless fortnight (Sinhala *māse poya*) or the night of the new moon (Sinhala *amāvaka poya*).

[^4]: lit., “it was”.

[^5]: or “all the color of gold” (*sabbasovaṇṇayā*).

[^6]: *pūjā*.

[^7]: “Five Lamps”

[^8]: BJTS reads “sixty leagues in height” and “thirty leagues in width”. In the parallel text \#15, below, this is the reading of both PTS and BJTS, but here PTS gives “a hundred” and “sixty” so I have retained that difference in the translation.

[^9]: lit., “as far as \[its extent\]”.

[^10]: reading *daṭṭhuṃ* (BJTS, PTS alt) for *dasuŋ* (PTS). PTS reads *daṭṭhuŋ* in the parallel text (\#15), below.

[^11]: BJTS reads “good rebirths and bad rebirths”.

[^12]: lit., “my eyes are not closing”

[^13]: lit., “because of \[my\] being endowed with meritorious karma”.

[^14]: or “pavilion”
