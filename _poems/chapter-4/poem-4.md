*\[4. Saṅkamanattā*[^1]*\]*

When Koṇḍañña, the Blessed One,

the World’s Best One, the Neutral One,

was traveling along the road,

making living beings cross over, (1) \[31\]

after coming out of \[my\] house,

with face cast down, I laid down \[there\].

The World’s Best One, Compassionate,

then took a step \[right\] on \[my\] head. (2) \[32\]

After having stepped on \[my\] head,

the Leader of the World \[then\] left.

Due to the pleasure in \[my\] heart,

I went to Tusitā \[Heaven\]. (3) \[33\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (4) \[34\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[35\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[36\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Saṅkamanattā spoke these verses.

The legend of Saṅkamanattā Therī is finished.
