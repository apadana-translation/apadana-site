### \[34. Sigālaka-mātā[^1]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
was a Master of Everything.  
\[That\] Leader arose in the world  
one hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[1185\]

I was born in Haṃsavatī,  
in a clan of ministers then,  
rich, prosperous, very wealthy,  
glistening with various gems. (2) \[1186\]

Going along with \[my\] father,  
surrounded by a multitude,  
having heard the Buddha’s Teaching,  
I went forth into homelessness. (3) \[1187\]

After going forth I gave up  
evil karma with the body.  
I purified my way of life,  
except for poor conduct through speech. (4) \[1188\]

Pleased in the Buddha, Teaching and  
Assembly; eager, respectful,  
used to hearing the great Teaching;  
I’m greedy to see the Buddha. (5) \[1189\]

I then heard \[of\] a Buddhist nun,  
foremost among those freed by faith.[^2]  
Aspiring to \[attain\] that place,  
I then fulfilled the three trainings.[^3]  
The Rest for Those Seeking Pity,[^4]  
the Well-Gone-One, thereupon said \[this\]: (6, 7a-b) \[1190\][^5]

“He[^6] whose faith in the Thus-Gone-One  
is well-established, not shaking,  
and whose morals[^7] are beautiful,  
dear to noble people, and praised; (7c-d, 8a-b) \[1191\]

whose insight is upright and whose  
pleasure[^8] is in the Assembly:  
it is said, “he is not wretched;”  
his life’s \[considered\] not useless. (8c-d, 9a-b) \[1192\]

Therefore, wise ones, commit \[yourselves\]  
to faith and to morality,  
to *Dhamma*-insight and pleasure;[^9]  
pith of Buddha’s dispensation.” (9c-d, 10a-b) \[1193\]

Hearing that, being overjoyed,  
I questioned \[him about\] my wish.  
Then the Supreme,[^10] Measureless One,[^11]  
the Guide,[^12] prophesied \[in this way:\] (10c-d, 11a-b) \[1194\]

“Lovely one, pleased in the Buddha,[^13]  
you will receive that well-wished \[place\].  
In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (11c-d, 12) \[1195\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
she named Sigālaka’s Mother  
will be the Teacher’s follower.” (13) \[1196\]

Gladdened after having heard that,  
with a heart that was \[full\] of love,  
as long as life I then served the  
Victor, Guide, through \[my\] practices.[^14] (14) \[1197\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (15) \[1198\]

And now, in \[my\] final rebirth,  
in Giribbaja,[^15] best city,  
\[I was\] born to rich millionaires,[^16]  
with a huge quantity of gems. (16) \[1199\]

My son was named Sigālaka,  
taking delight on the wrong road,  
slipped into the jungle of views,  
keen to worship the directions. (17) \[1200\]

Standing on the road, the Buddha,  
the Guide, advised him, seeing him  
coming toward the city praising  
the directions[^17] with balls of food. (18) \[1201\]

When he was preaching[^18] the *Dhamma*,  
there were amazing shrieks of joy;[^19]  
twenty million[^20] men \[and\] women  
gained insight into the Teaching.[^21] (19) \[1202\]

Then having gone \[into\] the crowd,  
having heard the Well-Gone-One’s speech,  
gaining the fruit of stream-entry,  
I went forth into homelessness. (20) \[1203\]

After not a very long time,  
hankering to see the Buddha,  
refining[^22] mindfulness \[through\] him,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (21) \[1204\]

I’m going[^23] every single day  
in order to see the Buddha.  
I’m dissatisfied looking at  
only \[his\] eye-pleasing body,[^24] (22) \[1205\]

produced by all the perfections,  
excellent lair of good fortune,  
\[his\] body, strewn with all goodness:  
dissatisfied, I’m living[^25] \[there\]. (23) \[1206\]

The Victor, pleased at that virtue,  
placed me in that foremost \[place:\]  
“The Mother of Sigālaka’s  
foremost among those freed by faith.”[^26] (24) \[1207\]

I’ve mastered the superpowers  
\[like\] the “divine ear” element.  
I’m also a master, Great Sage,  
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (25) \[1208\]

I remember \[my\] former lives;  
\[my\] “divine eye” is purified.  
All the defilements are destroyed;  
\[I\] will not be reborn again. (26) \[1209\]

In meaning and in the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
\[this\] knowledge of mine was produced  
in your presence, O Great Hero. (27) \[1210\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (28) \[1211\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (29) \[1212\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (30) \[1213\]

Thus indeed the bhikkhunī Sigālaka-mātā spoke these verses.

The legend of Sigālaka-mātā Therī[^27] is finished

[^1]: “Sigālaka’s Mother,” an historical nun, remembered as foremost among those who attained release through their faith. See DPPN II: 1133. She was the mother of Sigāla to whom the famous *Sigālovādasutta* was preached, upon which she also achieved fruits of the path.

[^3]: *tisso sikkhā*, i.e., training in morality (*sīla*), wisdom (*paññā*) and meditative states (*samādhi*)

[^4]: *karuṇānugatāsayo*, lit., “support for those come into/follow after/depend upon \[his\] pity (or compassion)”

[^5]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> presents the following speech of the Buddha in eight four-foot verses (6-13). <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> presents the same speech arranged into seven verses (\[1190-1196\], the first and last of which it presents as six-footed verses). I follow the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> numbering here, indicating corresponding numbering in the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition.

[^6]: the pronouns here are somewhat jarringly masculine ones, even though the subject is female

[^8]: *pasādo*

[^9]: *pasādaŋ*

[^10]: *anomo*

[^11]: *amito*

[^12]: *vināyako*

[^13]: both of these adjectives are in the vocative: “O beautiful one, O you whose pleasure is in the Buddha”

[^14]: *paṭipattīhi*

[^15]: = Rājagaha, Rajgir, in Bihār

[^16]: lit., “born in a rich clan of millionaires”

[^17]: *nānādisā*, lit., “various directions” “the different directions”

[^19]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *ninādo* for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *panādo*, though <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> alt. agrees with <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>. The term is singular so we might imagine some sort of shout in unison; I translate as “shrieks” (plural) given the context.

[^20]: *dvekoṭi*, lit., “two \[times\] ten million”

[^21]: lit., “there was an \[achieving of\] insight into the *Dhamma* of twenty million.” *Dhammâbhisamaya*, “insight into the *Dhamma*” or “entry into the *Dhamma*” or “comprehension of the *Dhamma”* or “penetration into the *Dhamma”* refers to the achievement of a firm grasp on the essentials of the Teaching. It is used as a technical term in the account of each Buddha in the *Buddhavaṃsa*, one among many categories of Buddha-achievement enumerated there.

[^22]: or “cultivating:” *bhāvetvā*
