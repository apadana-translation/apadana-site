*\[6. Ekapiṇḍadāyikā*[^1]*\]*  
In the city, Bandhumatī,  
there was a king[^2] named Bandhuma.[^3]  
I was \[then\] the wife of that king,  
behaving in a certain way.[^4] (1) \[46\]

Gone off alone, having sat down,  
I then reflected in this way:  
“I’ve done no wholesome \[deeds\] that \[I\]  
can take \[and\] go \[when I have died\]. (2) \[47\]

I have no doubt about the fact  
that I’ll certainly go to hell,  
blazingly hot, laden with grief,  
of frightful form, \[and\] very cruel.” (3) \[48\]

After having approached the king,  
I \[then\] spoke these words \[to him\]:  
“O kṣatriyan, do give to me  
one monk, \[whom\] I will \[thenceforth\] feed.” (4) \[49\]

That great king gave a monk to me,  
with cultivated faculties.  
After having taken his bowl,  
I satisfied \[him\] with milk-rice.[^5] (5) \[50\]

Having filled \[it\] up with milk-rice,  
I \[applied some\] scented ointment.  
Covering it with \[some\] netting,  
I closed \[it\] with a blue lotus.[^6] (6) \[51\]

Making that my object of thought[^7]  
for as long as \[my\] life \[lasted\],  
bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart there,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (7) \[52\]

I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of thirty kings among the gods.  
Whatever my mind wishes for  
comes into being as desired. (8) \[53\]

I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of twenty kings who turned the wheel.  
With accumulated \[merit,\]  
I transmigrated through lifetimes. (9) \[54\]

I am set free from every bond;  
my substrata are gone away;[^8]  
all defilements are extinguished;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (10) \[55\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave that almsgiving back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of food that’s begged for. (11) \[56\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (12) \[57\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (13) \[58\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[59\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Ekapiṇḍadāyikā spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ekapiṇḍadāyikā Therī is finished.

[^1]: “One Ball \[of Food\] Donor”. BJTS reads Ekapiṇḍapātadāyikā, “Giver of one begged-for-alms-meal”

[^2]: lit., “a kṣatriyan”.

[^3]: “Kinsman,” according to my notes (ref?) also the name of the king-father of Vipassi Buddha

[^4]: BJTS reads *ekajjhaṃ,* “together \[with the king\] (?)”.

[^5]: lit., “the ultimate food.” See n. to *Therāpadāna* v. \[28-29\]

[^6]: BJTS reads *vatthayugena,* “with a pair of cloths”. Some PTS alt give *mahācolena*, “a big piece of cloth”. The term *mahānela* is obscure, but used again in *Therī-apadāna* v. \[79\], below, where it more clearly refers to a blue lotus flower (perhaps through conflation with *mahanel,* or *mānel,* one of the Sinhala names for the blue lotus flower \[*uppala*\]). This translation follows the lead of BJTS Sinhala gloss, which in the case of v. \[79\] takes the term to be equivalent to the Sinhala *mahanel.*

[^7]: lit., “Remembering that as my object of sense.” Buddhist schematics thought one such sense-object (Sinhala *aramuṇu*) and in context, the meaning is clearly that she continued to think about that almsgiving for the rest of her life.

[^8]: *upādikā,* the foundations of defilement (*kilesas). *
