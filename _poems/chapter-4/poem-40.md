*\[40. Selā*[^1]*\]*  
In this \[present\] lucky aeon,  
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,  
\[the Buddha\] known as Kassapa  
was born, the Best of Debaters. (1) \[1323\]  
I’m born in a lay Buddhist clan,  
in Śrāvasti, superb city.  
Having seen that superb Victor,  
and having heard \[him\] preach \[*Dhamma,*\] (2a-d)[^2] \[1324\]  
gone to that Hero for refuge,  
I undertook morality.  
Whenever that Great Hero, in  
the midst of the great populace, (2e-f, 3a-b) \[1325\]  
the Bull of Men was explaining  
his own supreme Awakening,  
things which formerly were unheard,  
starting with “\[life is\] suffering,” (3c-f) \[1326\]  
hearing that, \[and\] taking \[it\] up,  
insight, thinking, wisdom, science,  
and intuition rose in me,  
and I asked the monks \[about them\]. (4) \[1327\]  
In Kassapa’s dispensation,[^3]  
I practiced celibate \[nunhood\].[^4]  
Due to that karma, I was born  
in the city of the thirty.[^5] (5) \[1328\]  
And now, in \[my\] final rebirth,  
born in a large millionaire’s clan  
having approached and having heard  
the Buddha’s great truth-filled Teaching, (6) \[1329\]  
having gone forth, in no long time,  
I understood truth’s foundations;  
casting away all defilements,  
I achieved \[my\] arahantship. (7) \[1330\]  
I’ve mastered the superpowers  
\[like\] the “divine ear” element.  
I’m also a master, Great Sage,[^6]  
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (8) \[1331\]  
I remember \[my\] former lives;  
\[my\] “divine eye” is purified.  
All the defilements are destroyed;  
\[I\] will not be reborn again. (9) \[1332\]  
In meaning and in the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
\[this\] knowledge of mine was produced  
in your presence, O Great Hero. (10) \[1333\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (11) \[1334\]  
Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[1335\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (13) \[1336\]  
Thus indeed the bhikkhunī Selā spoke these verses.  
The legend of Selā Therī[^7] is finished  
The Summary:  
The kṣatriyans and the brahmins,  
likewise Uppaladāyikā,  
Sigālamātā and Sukkā,  
Abhirūpā, Aḍḍhakāsikā,  
the prostitute, so too Puṇṇā,  
and Ambapālī, Buddhist nun,  
and Selā \[then makes\] the tenth one.[^8]  
There are two hundred verses here,  
plus another forty-two more.[^9]  
The Kṣatriyan Chapter, the Fourth.[^10]  
And then there is the Summary of Chapters:  
Sumedhā, Ekuposathā,  
Kuṇḍalakesī Khattiyā  
one thousand three hundred verses  
mixed in with forty-seven \[more\].  
Along with *Uddāna* verses  
which are counted by those who know,  
there are one thousand three hundred  
verses plus fifty seven \[more\].[^11]  
The *Therī-apadāna* is Finished[^12]  
The *Apadāna* is Finished  
[^1]: “Stone,” known only here but treated as an historical nun by
    Malalasekera, DPPN II: 1290. BJTS reads *Pesalā*, here and elsewhere
    in this *apadāna* (= “Agreeable”)  
[^2]: PTS presents this and the following verse as six-footed verses,
    presenting in a total of three verses the same material in the same
    order that BJTS presents in four verses.  
[^3]: *kassape jinasāsane,* lit., “in the dispensation of the Victor,
    Kassapa \[Buddha\]”  
[^4]: reading *°brahmacariyam* with BJTS for PTS *°brahmaceram,* lit.,
    “the Brahma-life” “the holy life” “celibacy”  
[^5]: i.e., the thirty-three gods.  
[^6]: reading *mahāmune* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *mahāmuni,*
    Great Sage.  
[^7]: this is the BJTS reading for PTS *bhikkhunī Selā*  
[^8]: this line only in BJTS, which reads *Pesalā* here as elsewhere  
[^9]: these final two feet enumerating the verses in the chapter, like
    most of the expected chapter summary, appears in BJTS but not in
    PTS.  
[^10]: this appears only in BJTS, and appears before rather than after
    the chapter summary.  
[^11]: this colophonic verse appears in BJTS only; PTS omits it  
[^12]: this appears only in BJTS; PTS omits it
