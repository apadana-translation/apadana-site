### \[19. Uppalavaṇṇā[^1]\]

The nun \[named\] Uppalavaṇṇā,  
master of the superpowers,  
having worshipped the Teacher’s feet,  
spoke these words \[to him at that time:\] (1) \[511\]

“Birth and rebirth[^2] crossed beyond,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state.  
All suffering’s destroyed by me;  
I’m declaring \[it,\] O Great Sage. (2) \[512\]

Throughout the multitudes[^3] who are  
pleased in Buddha’s[^4] dispensation,  
if I’ve wronged \[some\] people may they  
forgive \[it\] facing[^5] the Victor. (3) \[513\]

Great Sage, I am declaring that  
if there’s \[some\] mistake \[I’ve made,\]  
transmigrating in existence,  
may you forgive that transgression.” (4) \[514\]

“Show \[your\] superpowers to those  
who practice my[^6] dispensation.  
Cut off today the doubts throughout  
the multitude, which is fourfold.”[^7] (5) \[515\]

“Great Hero, I am your daughter.  
O Wise One,[^8] O Effulgent One,[^9]  
I’ve done very difficult deeds,  
difficult and numerous \[too\]. (6) \[516\]

My \[skin\] is blue-lotus-colored;  
by name I am named “Blue Lotus.”[^10]  
I’m your follower, Great Hero,  
worshipping your feet, Eyeful One. (7) \[517\]

Rāhula[^11] and I myself  
due to our similar mindsets,  
were born in the same conditions[^12]  
various hundred many \[times\]. (8) \[518\]

Rebirth is together \[with him\]  
and after birth too, together.  
\[Now\] in \[our\] final existence  
both, \[born in\] varied[^13] conditions, (9) \[519\]

together: Rāhula’s \[your\] son;  
I’m \[your\] daughter, named “Blue Lotus.”  
See my superpowers, Hero;  
I’ll show \[my\] strength to the Teacher.” (10) \[520\]

She put the four great oceans down  
into the palm of \[her own\] hand,  
just like a youthful physician[^14]  
does oil destined for the bladder.[^15] (11) \[521\]

Tearing up earth, she put \[it\] down  
into the palm of \[her own\] hand,  
like a tender young boy[^16] picking  
a \[flower that’s\] full of color.[^17] (12) \[522\]

Her palm, \[big\] as the universe,[^18]  
covering \[the world\] from the top,  
caused raindrops of various hues  
to rain forth again and again. (13) \[523\]

Making earth into \[a\] mortar,  
making Mount Meru \[her\] pestle,  
as though a youthful grinding girl,  
grinding[^19] grain \[flour\], \[she made\] gravel. (14) \[524\]

“I am the Best Buddha’s daughter;  
by name I am named “Blue Lotus.”  
A master of superpowers,  
I practice your dispensation.” (15) \[525\]

Making varied transformations,[^20]  
showing them to the World’s Leader,  
announcing name and lineage,  
I worship \[your\] feet, Eyeful One. (16) \[526\]

I’ve mastered the superpower  
\[called\] the “divine ear” element.  
I’m also a master, Great Sage,  
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (17) \[527\]

I remember \[my\] former lives;  
\[my\] “divine eye” is purified.  
All the defilements are destroyed;  
\[I\] will not be reborn again. (18) \[528\]

In meaning and in the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
my knowledge is vast[^21] and flawless,  
through the Great Sage’s majesty. (19) \[529\]

In the presence and the absence[^22]  
of the Chief Victors, formerly,  
much service was performed by me  
for the sake of you,[^23] O Great Sage. (20) \[530\]

What good[^24] karma was done by me,  
formerly in existence, Sage;  
\[that\] merit heaped up by me was  
for the sake of you, Great Hero. (21) \[531\]

Avoiding[^25] wrong behavior[^26] \[and\]  
the \[nine\] impossible places;[^27]  
the ultimate life’s my duty  
for the sake of you, Great Hero. (22) \[532\]

I donated from my \[own funds\]  
ten thousand ten millions[^28] \[in gold\];  
my \[very\] life was abandoned  
for the sake of you, Great Hero.” (23) \[533\]

Then all of them, greatly composed,  
hands pressed together on \[their\] heads,  
said, “Sister, how’d you make the effort  
for such unmatched superpower?” \[534\][^29]  
One hundred thousand aeons hence  
I was a cobra\[-god\] maiden,  
known by the name of Vimala,[^30]  
well-honored among the maidens. (24) \[535\]

The great cobra Mahoraga,[^31]  
pleased in Buddha’s[^32] dispensation,  
invited Padumuttara  
of Great Power,[^33] with followers. (25) \[536\]

Sounding musical instruments,  
going out to meet the Sambuddha,  
he made the Buddha’s road ready[^34] —  
a pavilion made out of gems,  
a palanquin made out of gems,  
things to enjoy made out of gems,  
strewn with sand that was \[mixed with\] gems,  
adorned with flags \[covered in\] gems. (26-27) \[537-538\]

The World’s Leader, surrounded by  
the multitude, which is fourfold,  
sat down on an excellent seat  
there in Mahoraga’s palace. (28) \[539\]

The cobra-king, greatly famed one,  
gave excellent and excellent  
food and drink, hard food \[that’s filling,\]  
soft food \[to drink,\] very costly. (29) \[540\]

Having eaten, having rinsed the  
bowl completely, the Sambuddha  
\[then\] made \[an expression of\] thanks  
to \[us,\] the cobra\[-god\] maidens. (30) \[541\]

Discerning \[what was in\] my heart  
and \[my\] mind which was fixed \[on him,\]  
\[taking\] pleasure in the Teacher,  
\[when\] the cobra maidens had seen  
the one whose name was Best Lotus,  
Greatly Famed All-Knower[^35] in bloom,  
\[that\] Great Hero, at that moment,  
showed a nun with superpowers. (31-32) \[542-543\]

That Buddhist nun, very skillful,  
displayed diverse superpowers.  
Thrilling with delight, \[and\] awe-struck,  
I said this to \[him,\] the Teacher: (33) \[544\]

“I \[too\] saw the superpower  
of this happy \[Buddhist nun\].[^36]  
Just how, Hero, did she become  
so skillful[^37] in superpowers?” (34) \[545\]

“\[This nun\] with great powers is my  
legitimate daughter, mouth-born;[^38]  
she’s followed my instructions, thus[^39]  
she’s so skilled[^40] in superpowers.” (35) \[546\]

Hearing the words of the Buddha,  
delighted indeed I aspired,  
“I too shall become such a one,  
so skillful in superpowers. (36) \[547\]

I am delighted, I’m happy;  
in the not-yet-become future,  
\[my\] supreme aspiration reached,  
I will be like her, O Leader.” (37) \[548\]

Satisfying with food and drink[^41]  
the World’s Leader with Assembly,  
on a palanquin made of gems,  
within a shining pavilion, (38) \[549\]

I worshipped \[him,\] the World’s Leader,  
\[that\] my color should be that of  
an *aruṇa*[^42] \[type\] blue lotus,  
foremost flower of the cobras. (39) \[550\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (40) \[551\]

Fallen from there, being reborn  
as a human being, I gave  
a Self-Become \[Lonely Buddha\]  
alms food covered with lotuses. (41) \[552\]

In the ninety-first aeon hence  
the Leader known as Vipassi  
arose, the One Good to Look At,[^43]  
the One with Eyes for Everything. (42) \[553\]

Being a millionaire’s daughter  
in Benares, supreme city,  
inviting \[him,\] the Sambuddha,  
the World’s Leader with Assembly, (43) \[554\]

after donating a very  
large almsgiving to the Guide,[^44] and  
worshipping[^45] with lotuses, I  
wished through them for splendid color.[^46] (44) \[555\]

In this \[present\] lucky aeon  
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,  
\[the Buddha\] known as Kassapa[^47]  
was born, the Best of Debaters. (45) \[556\]

The attendant of the Great Sage  
was the ruler of men back then,  
the king of Kāsi, named Kiki,  
in Benares, greatest city. (46) \[557\]

I was that \[king’s\] second daughter,  
who was named Samaṇaguttā.[^48]  
Hearing the Best Victor’s Teaching,  
I chose \[to seek\] ordination. (47) \[558\]

Our father did not permit it;  
we \[stayed\] at home during that time,  
comfortable[^49] royal maidens  
doing \[our\] practice with vigor  
in virginal celibacy,  
for twenty times a thousand years,  
fond of waiting on the Buddha,  
\[the king’s\] seven joyful daughters. (48-49) \[559-560\]

Samaṇī, and Samaṇaguttā,[^50]  
Bhikkhunī, Bhikkhadāyikā,  
Dhammā, and also Sudhammā,  
and seventh Saṅghadāyikā, (50) \[561\]

\[now\] I, and \[the nun named\] Khemā,  
Paṭācārā and Kuṇḍalā,[^51]  
Kisāgotamī, Dhammadinnā,[^52]  
and Visākhā is the seventh. (51) \[562\]

Due to those karmas[^53] done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (52) \[563\]

Fallen from there, being reborn  
as a human, in a great clan,  
I gave an arahant a robe  
of costly saffron-colored silk.[^54] (53) \[564\]

Fallen from there, reborn among  
brahmins[^55] in Ariṭṭhapura,  
daughter of Tirīṭavaccha,  
I was charming[^56] Ummādantī.[^57] (54) \[565\]

Fallen from there, I \[was born\] in  
an undistinguished[^58] rural[^59] clan.  
I was then engrossed in guarding  
rice in a not-quite-ripened field. (55) \[566\]

Having seen a Lonely Buddha,  
giving \[him\] five hundred grains of  
roasted paddy,[^60] lotus-covered,  
I wished \[to have\] five hundred sons.[^61] (56) \[567\]

With those wishes[^62] having given  
honey to \[that\] Self-Become One,  
fallen from there I was reborn  
in a lotus in the forest. (57) \[568\]

Being the Kāsi king’s chief queen,  
I was respected and worshipped.[^63]  
I bore royal princes \[for him,\]  
not one fewer than five hundred. (58) \[569\]

When \[my sons\] had become young men,[^64]  
while sporting at \[their\] water sports,  
seeing fallen lotus \[petals,\]  
they turned into[^65] Lonely-Leaders.[^66] \[59\] \[570\]

I was then grieved, being bereft  
of those heroes who were \[my\] sons.[^67]  
Fallen \[from there\], I was born in  
a village near Isigili.[^68] (60) \[571\]

When \[I\], Buddha-mother \[reborn,\]  
then well-guarded myself,[^69]  
was going carrying rice gruel,[^70]  
having seen eight Lonely-Leaders  
going to the village for alms,  
I remembered \[my former\] sons.  
Then a stream of milk spurted out  
from me out of love for \[my\] sons. (61-62) \[572-573\]

And then I gave rice gruel to them,  
\[feeling\] well-pleased by \[my\] own hands.  
Fallen from there I was reborn  
in “Joy” with the thirty\[-three gods.\] (63) \[574\]

Feeling[^71] \[both\] happiness and pain,  
transmigrating from birth to birth,  
my \[very\] life was abandoned  
for the sake of you, Great Hero. (64) \[575\]

Thus suffering in varied forms,  
various forms of happiness:  
when \[my\] last rebirth was attained,  
I’m born in Śrāvasti city,  
in a wealthy millionaire’s clan,  
comfortable, decorated,[^72]  
glistening with various gems,  
endowed with every sense-pleasure. (65-66) \[576-577\]

I was respected and worshipped,[^73]  
revered, likewise \[also\] esteemed.  
I achieved radiant beauty,  
much-respected among the clans. (67) \[578\]

And I was very much desired,  
through the good fortune of beauty,  
desired by various hundreds  
of millionaire’s sons \[living there\]. (68) \[579\]

After abandoning \[my\] house,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
When eight months had not yet elapsed,  
I attained the Four \[Noble\] Truths. (69) \[580\]

“With[^74] superpowers creating  
a chariot with four horses,  
I will worship the feet of the  
Buddha, World’s Lord, Resplendent One.” (70) \[581\]

“O nun, having approached a tree in full bloom,  
you remain alone, at \[that\] *sāla* tree’s roots.  
You have no second in natural beauty.  
Foolish one, aren’t you afraid of wanton men?” (71) \[582\][^75]

“Even if a hundred thousand wanton men  
come to this place, should behave in such a way,  
I would not be terrified, not a hair raised:  
I’m not afraid of \[you,\] Death, when I’m alone. (72) \[583\]

I, this \[nun\] am disappearing;  
I am hiding in your belly;  
you do not see me, standing \[here\]  
in the \[spot\] between \[your\] eyebrows. (73) \[584\]

Becoming master of \[my\] mind,[^76]  
\[I\] developed[^77] superpowers;  
I’m liberated from all bonds:  
I am not afraid of you, friend. (74) \[585\]

Sense pleasures are[^78] swords \[and\] daggers;  
the heaps[^79] executioner’s blocks.  
I now dislike[^80] the enjoyment  
of sense-pleasures of which you spoke. (75) \[586\]

Everywhere, enjoyments are slain;  
the mass of darkness is destroyed.  
Know it like this, O evil one:  
you have been killed, O end-maker.” (76) \[587\]

The Victor, pleased by \[my\][^81] virtue,  
\[then\] placed me in that foremost place.  
To[^82] the crowds[^83] the Guide \[announced\] me  
“best[^84] of those[^85] with superpowers.” (77) \[588\]

The Teacher’s been worshipped by me;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught.  
The heavy load has been laid down,  
the ties to existence severed. (78) \[589\]

The reason for which I went forth  
from \[my\] home into homelessness —  
I have \[now\] achieved that purpose:  
destruction of all the fetters. (79) \[590\]

By the moment they’re bringing \[me\]  
monastic robes and begging bowls,  
\[all\] the requisites and lodgings,  
\[in\] the thousands from everywhere. (80) \[591\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (81) \[592\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (82) \[593\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (83) \[594\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Uppalavaṇṇā spoke these verses.

The legend of Uppalavaṇṇā Therī is finished.

[^1]: “Blue Lotus-Colored,” a historical nun, one of the two chief female followers and designated foremost among those nuns who possess the superpowers. See DPPN I: 418-421.

[^2]: or “transmigration,” *°saŋsārā*

[^3]: or “retinue” “following” “group” “people”

[^4]: lit., “the Victor’s”

[^5]: or “face-to-face with”

[^6]: this is the Buddha speaking, in response to Uppalavaṇṇā’s request to be forgiven any mistakes

[^7]: *catasso parisā*, I assume the monks, nuns, laymen and laywomen, but it could also be *catasso…kaṅkhā*, fourfold doubt

[^8]: *paññāvanta*

[^9]: *jutindhara*

[^10]: *nāmena Uppalanāmikā*

[^11]: the Buddha’s biological son

[^12]: *akasmiŋ sambhave*, lit., “in a single coming-to-be-with,” “in a single origin” “in a single production”. Rāhula and Uppalavaṇṇā were born in this present moment together to be (literal and figurative) son and (only figurative) daughter of the Buddha, that is brother and sister (only figuratively), having however experienced many previous lifetimes together — sometimes as literal brother and sister, or mother and son — in the *Jātaka* stories. For a mention of some of these, see DPPN I: 421. Because (as in the present birth) these “same origins” are not *always* familial/genealogical/literal, I have preserved the ambiguity of the Pāli (“being together”) in the translation, so the same word can be translated correspondingly in v. 519, below.

[^13]: reading *nānāsambhavā* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *nāmasambhavā*, (“Conditions in name” — to be read as “only figuratively” \[??\])

[^14]: *vejjo komārako*, “a juvenile doctor” or perhaps “a young/inexperienced doctor”? Or a pediatrician, i.e., “a doctor connected with juveniles”? It depends on/shapes the interpretation of this anyway ambiguous (to me) verse.

[^15]: *telaŋ vatthigataŋ c’eva*, i.e., administering an enema? Or *vatthigataŋ* as a second thing being handled (carefully, gingerly), not only oil but also that “gone to \[or from?\] the bladder”?

[^16]: reading *luñci komārako yuvā* with BJTS for PTS *luñciko mārako yuvā* (“plucky devilish youth”?)

[^17]: or is *cittapunna* the *name* of a flower, i.e., “picks a *cittapunna* flower”

[^18]: *cakkavālasamaŋ*, lit., “the same as the ring of cosmic mountains surrounding the universe”

[^19]: lit., “doing” “making”

[^20]: *nānāvikubbanaŋ*

[^21]: lit., “pure” (*suddhaŋ*)

[^22]: reading *sammukhā ca parammukhā* with BJTS (and PTS alts.) for PTS *saṅkamante nidassitaŋ* (“pointed out when transmigrating” ?)

[^23]: that is, for the sake of meeting you, in order to be part of your future dispensation, cf. how contemporary Buddhists perform service in the hopes of meeting Maitreya or some even further-into-the-future Buddha.

[^24]: or “wholesome”: *kusalaŋ*

[^25]: *vajjetvā*. Reading BJTS *parivajjentī* (also “avoiding” “abstaining from” “renouncing”) for PTS *paripācento* (“developing”) in the subsequent foot (note both recensions differently present it as a nine-syllable foot), but anyway leaving it untranslated here, lit., “avoiding avoiding”

[^26]: reading *anācāraŋ* with BJTS for PTS *anāvaraŋ* (“not mean” = “noble things; PTS alt. *bahuŋ janaŋ*, “many people” \[!\])

[^27]: *abhabba-ṭṭhāne*, the nine moral states or spheres of activity into which an arahant will not/cannot fall, D.iii.133 (and cf. D.iii.235 where only the first five appear as a set). This is *Pāsādika Sutta*, \#29 of *Dīghanikāya*, section 26. The nine are: (1) cannot deliberately take the life of a living being (2) cannot steal (3) cannot have sexual intercourse (4) cannot deliberately lie (5) cannot hoard anything for his own indulgence (6) cannot act wrongly through attachments (7) cannot act wrongly through hatred (8) cannot act wrongly through folly (9) cannot act wrongly through fear

[^28]: or “one hundred billion”

[^29]: this verse does not appear in PTS. BJTS reads: *tadātisaṃhitā sabbā sirasāva katañjalī*/*avoc’ ayye kathaṃ āsi atul’iddhiparakkamā*//

[^30]: “Stainless”

[^31]: “great snake,” *mahā* + *urago*

[^32]: *jina°*, lit., “the Victor’s”

[^33]: *mahātajaŋ*, or “the Hot One”

[^34]: reading *paṭiyādesi* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *paṭipādesi*, to impart, to offer, to present

[^35]: reading *sabbaññuṃ* with BJTS for PTS *sabbañ ca* (“all…and”)

[^36]: reading *sumanāy’ itarāyapi* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *sumitaŋ itarāya pi* (“well-measured by the other to” ?), and following BJTS Sinhala gloss

[^37]: reading *suvisāradā* with BJTS (and subsequent verses here) for PTS *ca visāradā* (“and skillful”)

[^38]: *orasāmukhato jātā*

[^39]: lit., “and”

[^40]: reading *suvisāradā* with BJTS for PTS *ca visāradā*, as above

[^41]: reading *annapānena* with BJTS for PTS *mahājanena* (“with the great multitude”)

[^42]: “sun”

[^43]: *carunayano*

[^44]: reading *vināyakaṃ* with BJTS (and PTS alts.) for PTS *vimissitaŋ* (“mixed”)

[^45]: lit., “doing *pūjā*”

[^46]: reading *vaṇṇasobhaṃ* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *vaṇṇasetaŋ* (“white color” ?)

[^47]: BJTS reads “Named Kassapa according to his Lineage (*gottena*)”

[^48]: ”Guarded Nun” “Protected Female Renouncer”

[^49]: *sukhe ṭhitā*, lit., “remaining in comfort.” Pronounce all four syllables when chanting to keep the meter or, to chant as a three-syllable word, read “comfortable royal princesses”

[^50]: I follow the original (in both recensions) in making this first foot a nine-syllable foot through the addition of the (superfluous) “and” (*ca*). The comma amplifies its effect, to syncopate the verse such that the (respective, exact) parallelism of the following verse (in which, however, all four feet contain the expected eight syllables) becomes apparent.

[^51]: = Bhaddā Kuṇḍalakesī

[^52]: given the long names, this foot is unavoidably nine-syllables long, both in Pāli and in English

[^53]: here the text (in both PTS and BJTS editions) substitutes *tehi kammehi* (plural instrumental) for the ordinary *tena kammena* (singular instrumental) in this *Apadāna* stock phrase. Perhaps “good deeds” would be better here.

[^54]: *pīta-maṭṭha-varaŋ dussaŋ*, BJTS (and PTS alt.) read *pītamaṭṭhaṃ varaṃ dussaṃ*

[^55]: in a brahmin clan

[^56]: *manohara*, lit., “carrying the mind away”

[^57]: “Maddening” “Intoxicating”

[^58]: *aññatare*, or “a certain”

[^59]: *janapade*, lit., “in the country”

[^60]: *lāja*

[^61]: BJTS reads *pañcaputtasatāni pi* (“and also \[my\] five hundred sons”), in keeping with its variant reading of the first foot of the following verse

[^62]: BJTS reads *te pi* *patthesuṃ* (“and they \[the five hundred sons posited as already-existing in the BJTS variant of the prior verse\] wished”) for PTS *tesu patthesu*, “with those wishes”

[^63]: lit., “offered *pūjā*”

[^64]: *yobbanaŋ pattā*, lit., “attained youth,” “went through puberty”

[^65]: lit., “they were”

[^66]: *paccekanāyakā*, i.e., Paccekabuddhas, Lonely Buddhas

[^67]: *sutavīrehi*. BJTS reads *sutavarehi* (“excellent sons”)

[^68]: one of the five mountains surrounding Rajagaha (a.k.a. Giribajjapura, now Rajgir in Bihar, India), famous as the long-time home of five hundred Lonely Buddhas

[^69]: *su-tānaka-sakaŋ*. BJTS reads

[^70]: *yāguŋ*

[^71]: or “experiencing:” *anubhotvā*

[^72]: *sukhite sajjite tathā;* when chanting pronounce “comfortable” as four syllables, or insert “and” to pronounce it as three syllables.

[^73]: lit., “offered *pūjā*”

[^74]: this and the following five verses seem to be a dialogue between the nun and Death (*Māra*) or “the Evil One” (*Pāpimant*) personified; this first verse is thought by her, v. 71 is spoken by Death, v. 72-76 contain her response, addressed to him in the second person, while v. 77 suggests that the Buddha witnesses the scene.

[^75]: this and the next verse are presented with feet of eleven syllables each in both PTS and BJTS and I translate accordingly. The present verse has 12 syllables in the first foot, which I take as a mistake (read *pupphitaggaṃ* for *supupphitaggaŋ* ?).

[^76]: *cittasmiŋ vasibhūtasmiŋ*, lit., “when i became master of (or “over”) \[my own\] mind”

[^77]: *subhāvitā*, lit., “\[by me\] well-developed” or “well-cultivated” “well-meditated”

[^78]: *sattisūlūpamā kāmā*, lit., “swords \[and\] daggers are like (or “are similes for”) sense pleasures”

[^79]: *khandhā pi adhikuṭṭanā*, lit., “even the aggregates (or dimensions \[of personal existence: name and form, sensation, perception, configuration and consciousness\])

[^80]: lit., “is now disliked by me”

[^81]: lit., “in the” “in that”

[^82]: lit., “among”

[^83]: or assemblies (even four parts of the Assembly), multitudes, retinues

[^84]: *seṭṭhaŋ*, etymologically related to her designation “millionaire;” BJTS, more typical of the whole work, reads *aggaṃ*, “\[she is\] foremost”

[^85]: *°matīnaŋ*, lit., “of those (females) endowed”
