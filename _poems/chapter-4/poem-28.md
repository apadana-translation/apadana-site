### \[28. Yasodharā\]

At one time the Leader of Men  
was staying in a mountain cave  
in the city, Rajagaha,  
\[which was\] lovely and prosperous. \[952\][^1]

This is what was reasoned out \[then\]  
by the nun \[named\] Yasodharā,  
who was dwelling in that city,  
inside a lovely convent \[there\]: \[953\]

"Nanda, Rahula and Bhadda;  
likewise the two chief followers;  
Suddhodana Maharaja,  
and Gotamī Pajāpatī; \[954\]

the great theras of great renown;  
and the therīs with great powers:[^2]  
they've gone to peaceful \[nirvana\],  
traceless like the flame of a lamp. \[955\]

While the World's Lord still is living,  
I’ll travel that peaceful path too.”  
And having reasoned \[all\] that out,  
she foresaw the end of her life. \[956\]

Foreseeing that life’s aggregates  
would be destroyed that very day,  
she set out from her own ashram,  
carrying her robe and her bowl. \[957\]

Honored by one hundred thousand[^3]  
nuns, \[the nun named Yasodharā,\]  
greatly powerful, greatly wise,  
\[then\] went up to the Sambuddha. (1) \[958\]

Having worshipped the Sambuddha,  
at the wheel-marked \[soles of his feet\],  
sitting off to one side \[of him,\]  
she spoke these words to the Teacher: (2) \[959\]

“I'm seventy-eight years old now,  
the last of old age has arrived;  
I'm reporting to the Great Sage:  
I've attained \[sainthood\] in a cave. (3) \[960\]

Old age has ripened for me \[now\];  
verily my life's a trifle.  
Giving all you up I will go:  
my refuge is made in myself. (4) \[961\]

In the final days of old age,  
death breaks \[the body into bits\];  
today at nighttime, Great Hero,  
I shall achieve my nirvana. (5) \[962\]

Where there's no birth, no growing old,  
nor sickness and death, O Great Sage,  
I'm going to the \[great\] city  
\[which,\] unconditioned, has no death. (6) \[963\]

Throughout \[this vast\] multitude here,[^4]  
\[all these\] revering[^5] the Teacher,[^6]  
know that \[every\] imperfection  
is forgiven face-to-face, Sage. (7) \[964\]

Transmigrating in existence,  
if I have \[ever\] disturbed you,[^7]  
I’m announcing it, Great Hero;  
please forgive my imperfection. (8) \[965\]

After hearing \[that\] speech of hers,  
the Lord of Sages[^8] \[then\] said this:  
“What better can I say to you,  
when you’re going to nirvana? \[966\]

Now[^9] display \[your\] superpowers,  
doer of my dispensation;  
let doubt in the dispensation  
be cut off for all assemblies.”[^10] (9) \[967\]

Having heard the words of the Sage,  
the Buddhist nun, Yasodharā,  
worshipping the King of Sages,  
\[then\] spoke this speech to the \[Buddha:\] \[968\]

"I am Yasodharā, Hero;  
in the home I was your chief queen,[^11]  
born in the clan of the Śākyas,  
established among the women.[^12] (10) \[969\]

In your household, O Hero, I  
was the leader, the lord of all  
of the \[women there, who numbered\]  
one hundred thousand ninety six. (11) \[970\]

All of those women, endowed with  
the virtues of beauty and grace,  
youthful and well-spoken, revere  
me, like people \[revere\] the gods.[^13] (12) \[971\]

Leader of a thousand maidens  
in the home of the Śākyan Son,  
they’re the same in pleasure and pain,[^14]  
like gods in \[the garden named\] “Joy.” (13) \[972\]

Beyond the essence of desire,  
fixed as the essence of beauty,  
\[they’re\] unmatched in terms of beauty,  
other than \[by\] the World’s Leader.” (14) \[973\]

Speaking \[words\] beginning with these,  
having risen into the sky,  
Yasodharā displayed diverse  
powers,[^15] with Buddha’s permission. \[974\][^16]

Worshipping[^17] the Sambuddha, she  
showed the Teacher superpowers.[^18]  
She displayed great superpowers,  
diverse, having various forms. (15)[^19]

Body big as the universe,[^20]  
she \[made\] the continent[^21] up north  
her head; eastern, western \[her\] wings;  
\[and made\] India her torso; (16) \[975\]

tail feathers: the southern ocean;  
\[other\] feathers: varied rivers;  
\[her\] eyes were the moon and the sun,  
\[her\] crest was cosmic Mount Meru. (17) \[976\]

\[In her\] beak, mountain at world’s end,[^22]  
\[she carried\] a tree[^23] with its roots.  
Coming up to \[him,\] fanning \[him,\]  
she’s worshipping the World’s Leader. (18) \[977\]

She made herself[^24] an elephant,  
likewise a horse, mountain, ocean,  
the moon and the sun, Mount Meru,  
and Śakra, \[the king of the gods\]. (19) \[978\]

She covered the thousand-fold world  
with blooming lotus,[^25] \[and then said,\]  
“I am Yasodharā, Hero;  
I worship \[your feet\], Eyeful One." (20) \[979\]

And making Brahma’s form appear,  
she preached the doctrine of merit;[^26]  
"I am Yasodharā, Hero;  
I worship your feet, Eyeful One.” (21) \[980\]

I’ve mastered the superpowers  
\[like\] the “divine ear” element.  
I’m also a master, Great Sage,  
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (22) \[981\]

I remember \[my\] former lives;  
\[my\] “divine eye” is purified.  
All the defilements are destroyed;  
\[I\] will not be reborn again. (23) \[982\]

In meaning and in the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
\[this\] knowledge of mine was produced  
in your presence, O Great Hero. (24) \[983\]

\[My\] meeting with \[all\] the Buddhas,[^27]  
the World-Lords, was well-seen by you;[^28]  
my extensive service \[to them\]  
was for the sake of you, Great Sage. (25) \[984\]

O Sage, recall the good karma,  
which formerly \[was done\] by me;  
\[that\] merit was heaped up by me  
for the sake of you, Great Hero. (26) \[985\]

I kept from misconduct, hindered[^29]  
the \[nine\] impossible places;[^30]  
I have sacrificed[^31] life \[itself\]  
for the sake of you, Great Hero. (27) \[986\]

I gave myself to be a wife,  
several tens of billions \[of times\].  
I was not distressed about that,  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. (28) \[987\]

I gave myself to do service,  
several tens of billions \[of times\].  
I was not distressed about that,  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. (29) \[988\]

I gave myself to \[provide\] food,  
several tens of billions \[of times\].  
I was not distressed about that,  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. (30) \[989\]

I have given you \[all my\] lives,  
several tens of billions \[of times\].  
I’ll liberate \[myself\] from fear,  
giving up my life \[once more\]. (31) \[990\]

Great Sage, for your sake I do not[^32]  
conceal the things of a woman,  
numerous clothes of varied types,  
ornaments affixed to[^33] \[my\] limbs. (32) \[991\]

Wealth and grain have been given up,  
villages and also small towns,  
fields and sons and daughters \[as well\]  
have been given up, O Great Sage. (33) \[992\]

Elephants, horses, also cows,  
slaves \[as well as\] servant-women  
are given up beyond all count  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. (34) \[993\]

Whatever I am told \[to give\]  
as alms to beggars, I give \[that\];  
I don’t witness[^34] any distress  
from giving the ultimate gift. (35) \[994\]

I have experienced[^35] dis-ease  
of diverse types, beyond all count,  
in \[this\] much-varied existence[^36]  
for the sake of you, Great Hero. (36) \[995\]

Attaining comfort\[s,\] I don’t thrill;  
\[I do\]n’t get distressed by[^37] troubles.  
Everywhere I remain balanced  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage. (37) \[996\]

After experiencing \[both\]  
pleasure \[and\] pain along the way,  
the Great Sage reached Awakening,  
the Teaching for which[^38] Buddha[^39] strived. (38) \[997\]

By you \[and\] by me there was much  
meeting with the other World-Lords,  
\[whether you’re\] the god Brahmā or[^40]  
Gotama Buddha,[^41] World’s Leader. (39) \[998\]

I performed a lot of service,  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage;  
while you sought the Buddha's Teaching,[^42]  
I was \[always\] your attendant. (40) \[999\]

One hundred thousand aeons \[and\]  
four incalculable \[aeons\]  
hence, Dīpaṅkara, Great Hero,  
the Leader of the World was born. (41) \[1000\]

\[Some\]place in a nearby country,  
inviting \[him,\] the Thus-Gone-One,  
happy-minded folks are cleaning  
the road \[on which\] he is coming. (42) \[1001\]

At that time there was a brahmin  
\[known by\] the name of Sumedha.  
He was making the road ready  
for the All-Seer who was coming. (43) \[1002\]

At that time I was a maiden,  
born in a brahmin \[family\],  
known by the name of Sumittā.  
I went up to that gathering. (44) \[1003\]

With eight handfuls of blue lotus  
for offering[^43] to the Teacher,  
in the midst of \[all\] the people  
I saw that fierce \[ascetic\] sage.[^44] (45) \[1004\]

Seeing \[him,\] seated atop bark,[^45]  
surpassing[^46] \[and\] captivating,[^47]  
then I thought \[like this to myself:\]  
“\[this\] life of mine is bearing fruit.” (46) \[1005\]

At that time I saw \[that\] sage’s  
effort \[which was then\] bearing fruit;  
due to previous karma, my  
heart was pleased in the Sambuddha. (47) \[1006\]

Making \[my\] heart even more pleased,  
I said, “O lofty-minded sage,  
seeing no other gift \[to give,\]  
I’m giving flowers to you, sage.[^48] (48) \[1007\]

There are five handfuls for you, sage;  
the \[remaining\] three[^49] are for me.  
Let there be success through[^50] this \[gift\]  
for your Awakening,[^51] O sage.” (49) \[1008\]

The Fourth Recitation Portion  
\[Then that\] sage, taking the flowers,  
for the sake of Awakening,[^52]  
worshipped amidst the people the  
Famed One, Great Sage[^53] who was coming. (50) \[1009\]

The Great Sage \[named\] Dīpaṅkara,  
seeing \[him\] amidst the people,  
prophesied[^54] \[future Buddhahood\]  
\[for that\] sage with a lofty mind. (51) \[1010\]

The Great Sage \[named\] Dīpāṅkara  
\[then\] prophesied that my karma  
would for numberless aeons hence  
be exalted, that Sage So Great: (52)[^55]

“She will be a like-minded \[wife\],  
with karma and conduct like \[yours\];  
through this karma she’ll be loving  
for the sake of you, O great sage.[^56] (53) \[1011\]

Nice looking and much beloved,  
desirable,[^57] speaking sweet words,  
she will be a loving woman,  
\[and\] an heir among \[your\] doctrines. (54) \[1012\]

Just as masters are protecting[^58]  
the goods that \[they\] accumulate,  
so this one likewise will protect  
\[all\] of the things that are wholesome. (55) \[1013\]

Compassionate for \[future\] you,  
she will fulfill the perfections.  
Like a lion \[freed\] from a cage,  
she will achieve Awakening.” (56) \[1014\]

Rejoicing about \[Buddha’s\] speech,  
I lived behaving in that way  
the Buddha prophesied for me  
numberless aeons ago. (57) \[1015\]

I brought pleasure to \[my\] mind when  
that karma was well done \[by me\];  
I experienced countless wombs,  
divine \[as well as\] human \[ones\]. (58) \[1016\]

Undergoing pleasure \[and\] pain,  
among gods \[and\] human beings,  
when \[my\] last rebirth was attained,  
I was born in the Śākyan clan. (59) \[1017\]

Beautiful and very wealthy,  
famous and likewise virtuous;  
endowed with every attainment,  
I’m much-honored among the clans. (60) \[1018\]

Riches, fame, hospitality,  
\[and\] indulgence in worldly things –  
\[they\] do not agitate \[my\] mind;[^59]  
I have no fear from anything. (61) \[1019\]

I was appointed to attend  
on what the Blessed One had said  
within the harem of the king  
in the kṣatriyan city then. (62)[^60]

\[I’m\] a woman who’s a servant,  
and \[one\] who feels pleasure and pain,  
a woman[^61] who declares the facts,  
a woman[^62] who’s compassionate. (63)  
Buddhas \[numbering\] five billion,  
and \[another\] nine billion \[more\] —  
I provided vast alms to \[them,\]  
those \[Buddhas,\] Gods Over the Gods.[^63] (64)

Listen to my \[words,\] O great king:  
I’m constantly doing service[^64]  
to eleven billion \[others,\]  
and fifty billion \[Buddhas more\]. (65)

I provided vast alms to \[them,\]  
those \[Buddhas,\] Gods Over the Gods;  
listen to my \[words\], O great king:  
I’m constantly doing service. (66)

Twenty billion \[other\] Buddhas  
and \[another\] thirty billion –  
I provided vast alms to \[them,\]  
those \[Buddhas,\] Gods Over the Gods. (67)

Listen to my \[words,\] O great king:  
I’m constantly doing service  
to forty billion \[Buddhas more,\]  
and \[another\] fifty billion. (68)

I provided vast alms to \[them,\]  
those \[Buddhas,\] Gods Over the Gods;  
listen to my words, O great king:  
I’m constantly doing service. (69)

Sixty billion \[other\] Buddhas,  
\[another\] seventy billion –  
I provided vast alms to \[them,\]  
those \[Buddhas,\] Gods Over the Gods. (70)

Listen to my \[words,\] O great king:  
I’m constantly doing service  
to eighty billion \[Buddhas more,\]  
and \[another\] ninety billion. (71)

I provided vast alms to \[them,\]  
those \[Buddhas,\] Gods Over the Gods;  
listen to my \[words,\] O great king:  
I’m constantly doing service. (72)

There have been a million million  
who were Chief Leaders of the World;  
I provided vast alms to \[them,\]  
those \[Buddhas,\] Gods Over the Gods. (73)

Listen to my \[words,\] O great king:  
I’m constantly doing service  
to another ninety trillion  
who were Leaders of the World \[too.\] (74)

I provided vast alms to \[them,\]  
those \[Buddhas,\] Gods Over the Gods;  
listen to my \[words,\] O great king:  
I’m constantly doing service (75)

to Great Sages \[whose number was\]  
eight hundred and fifty trillion,  
and seven hundred eighty-five  
billion \[additional Buddhas\]. (76)

I provided vast alms to \[them,\]  
those \[Buddhas,\] Gods Over the Gods;  
listen to my \[words,\] O great king:  
I’m constantly doing service. (77)

Lonely Buddhas, passion removed,  
six hundred and forty million;  
listen to my \[words,\] O great king:  
I’m constantly doing service. (78)

Countless followers of Buddhas,  
free of defilements, \[and\] stainless;  
listen to my \[words,\] O great king:  
I’m constantly doing service. (79)

I always practice[^65] the Teaching[^66]  
of those practiced in the teachings,[^67]  
at ease practicing the Teaching,  
in this world and in the other. (80)

Well-practiced, the Teaching-practice;  
that practice is not ill-practiced.  
\[I’m\] at ease practicing Teaching,  
in this world and in the other. (81)

Disgusted with transmigration,  
I went forth into homelessness,  
surrounded by thousands \[of nuns,\]  
after renouncing with nothing. (82) \[1020\]

After abandoning \[my\] home,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
When eight months[^68] had not yet elapsed  
I attained the Four \[Noble\] Truths. (83) \[1021\]

Like the waves upon the ocean,  
\[folks\] are bringing many varied[^69]  
monastic robes and alms to eat,  
requisites \[as well as\] lodgings. (84) \[1022\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (85) \[1023\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (86) \[1024\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (87) \[1025\]

Thus many sorts of suffering  
and many types of happiness;  
the pure life \[now\] has been achieved,  
I have obtained all achievements. \[1026\][^70]

The woman who’s giving herself  
for the merit of the Great Sage  
attains companionship \[with him\],  
\[and\] unconditioned nirvana. \[1027\]

The past is thoroughly destroyed,  
and the present \[and\] the future;  
all of my karma is destroyed:  
I worship your feet, Eyeful One.” \[1028\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Yasodharā spoke these verses.

[^54]: lit., “the Great Hero prophesied”

[^55]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> consigns this verse to an asterisked footnote, recognizing that it occurs in a number of its alternate recensions.

[^56]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> agrees with <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> in presenting this as *mahā-ise* (voc.) but reference alternate readings *mahā-isi* (nom.), presumably troubled by the Buddha addressing Sumedha as “Great Sage”

[^70]: this and the following concluding verses do not appear here in <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>, and are unusual (though not unique) for *Apadāna* in which individual poems usually conclude with what I’ve dubbed the “concluding refrain” (vv. 85-87) \[1023-1025\]. Interestingly they (plus one more, also duplicated elsewhere) do appear, in the same unusual post-refrain position, below, as vv. 57-59 (plus 60) of *apadāna* \#30, Eighteen Thousand Nuns with Yasodharā, and are also in this position in the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> version of that *apadāna* (vv. \[1100-1102\] plus \[1103\]).

[^71]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> omits Therī, which I supply from <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>.
