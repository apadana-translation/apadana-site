*\[13. Modakadāyikā*[^1]*\]*  
In the city, Bandhumatī,  
I was a water-jug slave-girl.  
After receiving my wages,  
I went with a water-fetcher. (1) \[159\]  
Having seen a monk on the road,  
attentive with a \[well-\]calmed heart,  
happy, with pleasure in my heart,  
I gave \[the monk\] three sweetmeats \[then\]. (2) \[160\]  
Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
for one more than ninety aeons  
I went not to a place of grief. (3) \[161\]  
Giving \[him\] material goods,  
I then experienced all of that.  
Having given \[those\] three sweetmeats  
I attained the unshaking state. (4) \[162\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[163\]  
Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[164\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[165\]  
Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Modakadāyikā[^2] spoke these verses.  
The legend of Modakadāyikā Therī is finished.  
[^1]: “Sweetmeat Donor”.  
[^2]: here PTS reads the name Timodakadāyikā, “Three-Sweetmeat-Donor”
