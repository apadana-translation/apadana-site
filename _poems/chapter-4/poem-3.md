*\[3. Maṇḍapadāyikā*[^1]*\]*

A pavilion was built by me

for Buddha Koṇāgamana,

and I gave robes unceasingly

to the Buddha, the World’s Kinsman. (1) \[26\]

Whichever country I go to,

a small town \[or\] royal city,

I’m given *pūjā* everywhere:

that is the fruit of good karma.[^2] (2) \[27\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (3) \[28\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[29\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[30\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Maṇḍapadāyikā spoke these verses.

The legend of Maṇḍapadāyikā Therī is finished.

[^1]: “Raised-Platform-Donor”.

[^2]: lit., “of meritorious karma”.
