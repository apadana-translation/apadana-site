### \[32. Eighty-Four Thousand Brahmin Maiden Buddhist Nuns[^1]\]

O Great Sage,[^2] in your city are  
eighty-four thousand \[young women,\]  
with \[very\] tender hands \[and\] feet,  
who have been born in brahmin clans. (1) \[1116\]

O Great Sage,[^3] in your city are  
many maidens from every land,[^4]  
born in Vaiśya and Śudra clans,  
and gods, snake\[-gods\] and *kinnaras*. (2) \[1117\]

Some of them \[already\] went forth;  
many have insight into truth;  
the gods, *kinnaras* and snake\[-gods\]  
will enjoy[^5] \[this\] in the future. (3) \[1118\]

Experiencing every fame,  
achieving every achievement,  
\[those who’ve\] obtained pleasure in you  
will enjoy \[it\] in the future. (4) \[1119\]

And[^6] we’re the daughters of brahmins,  
who have been born in brahmin clans.  
Out of our desire,[^7] Great Sage,  
we worship \[your\] feet, Eyeful One. (5) \[1120\]

All existences have been reached,[^8]  
cravings are torn out by the roots;  
latent tendencies are cut off,  
merit\[-based\] aggregates broken. (6) \[1121\]

All pasture in meditation,[^9]  
likewise have mastered altered states;[^10]  
we will always live delighting  
in the Teaching through altered states.[^11] (7) \[1122\]

The ties to being, ignorance,  
the aggregates, too, are cast off.  
We’re born, O Leader, having gone  
on the path very hard to see. (8) \[1123\]

“For a long time you have been my[^12]  
servants, doing what’s to be done.  
Cutting off the doubts of many,  
may you all go to nirvana.” (9) \[1124\]

Having worshipped the Sage’s feet,  
they performed \[their\] superpowers.[^13]  
Some are showing \[very bright light,\]  
and after that making \[it\] dark. (10) \[1125\]

They are showing the moon \[and\] sun,  
and the \[great\] ocean with \[its\] fish;  
they’re showing Mount Meru and the  
Coral Tree[^14] \[in heaven,\] girdled. (11) \[1126\]

Through superpower they’re showing  
Tāvatiṃsa and Yāma spheres,  
Tusitā \[and\] Nimmitā gods,  
\[and\] the Vasavatti great lords. (12) \[1127\]

Some are showing the Brahmā \[gods\]  
and a very costly walkway;  
making \[themselves\] look like[^15] Brahmā,  
they preach the *Dhamma* that’s empty.[^16] (13) \[1128\]

Doing varied transformations,  
showing Buddha[^17] superpowers,  
they all demonstrated \[their\] strength,  
\[then they\] worshipped the Teacher’s feet. (14) \[1129\]

We’ve mastered the superpowers  
\[like\] the “divine ear” element.  
We’re also the masters, Great Sage,  
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (15) \[1130\]

We remember \[our\] former lives;  
\[our\] “divine eye\[s\]” are purified.  
All the defilements are destroyed;  
\[we\] will not be reborn again. (16) \[1131\]

In meaning and in the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
\[this\] knowledge of ours was produced  
in your presence, O Great Hero.[^18] (17) \[1132\]

Our[^19] meeting with \[all\] the Buddhas,  
the World-Lords, was displayed \[to you\];  
our extensive service \[to them\]  
was for the sake of you, Great Sage. (18) \[1133\]

O Sage, recall the good karma,  
which formerly \[was done\] by us;  
\[that\] merit was heaped up by us  
for the sake of you, Great Hero. (19) \[1134\]

One hundred thousand aeons hence  
Padumuttara was the Sage.[^20]  
The city named Haṃsavatī  
was the home of \[that\] Buddha’s clan. (20) \[1135\]

The Ganges River always flows  
past the gate of Haṃsavatī.  
Buddhist monks are troubled by the  
river, unable to[^21] proceed. (21) \[1136\]

A day, \[then\] two, and then \[it’s\] three,  
after that a week, \[next\] a month,  
then fully four months \[might pass for  
those monks\], unable to[^22] proceed. (22) \[1137\]

Then the future Buddha[^23] was a  
local leader,[^24] named Jaṭila.  
Seeing \[those\] stranded Buddhist monks  
he made[^25] a bridge on the river.[^26] (23) \[1138\]

Then, with a hundred thousand \[spent,\]  
the bridge on the river made, he[^27]  
made a monastery for the  
Assembly on the nearer bank. (24) \[1139\]

The women as well as the men,  
from clans of high \[and\] low status,  
provided[^28] \[funds for\] equal shares  
in his bridge and monastery. (25) \[1140\]

We and the other women \[too,\]  
in the city and countrysides,  
who had minds that were very clear,  
were \[rightful\] heirs of that karma. (26) \[1141\]

Women \[and\] men[^29] and boys \[as well,\]  
and also numerous young girls,  
\[joined together\] to spread \[clean\] sand,  
for his bridge and monastery. (27) \[1142\]

Sweeping the roadway, making flags,  
plantain-banners,[^30] pots of plenty,[^31]  
and having honored the Teacher  
with incense, cunnam and garlands, (28) \[1143\]

having made the monastery  
and the bridge, inviting the Guide,  
after giving extensive alms,  
he[^32] aspired to Awakening.[^33] (29) \[1144\]

Padumuttara, Great Hero,  
Crosser-Over[^34] of all that breathe,  
the Great Sage made[^35] \[his\] thanksgiving  
to \[bodhisattva\] Jaṭila:[^36] (30) \[1145\]

“Undergoing life after life,  
when one hundred thousand \[aeons\]  
have passed, \[in\] the “lucky” aeon,  
he will attain Awakening. (31) \[1146\]

These men and women who’ve arranged  
by hand[^37] what work was to be done,  
will all in futures[^38] yet to come  
be \[born together\] face-to-face.[^39] (32) \[1147\]

As the result of that karma,  
\[done\] with intention and resolve,  
reborn in heavens of the gods,  
they will \[all\] be your attendants.”[^40] (33) \[1148\]

Transmigrating life after life,  
a long time we experienced[^41]  
countless \[years of\] divine pleasure  
and countless \[such\] human \[rebirths\]. (34) \[1149\]

For one hundred thousand aeons,  
well-done karma’s attainment, we’re  
tender girls among men; likewise  
in the superb city of gods. (35) \[1150\]

Beautiful, wealthy and famous,  
and also praised and respected,  
we are constantly receiving  
\[that\] well-done karma’s attainment. (36) \[1151\]

When \[our\] last rebirth was attained,  
we are born[^42] in a brahmin clan,  
with \[very\] tender hands \[and\] feet,  
in the home of the Śākyan prince.[^43] (37) \[1152\]

We are never[^44] seeing the earth  
when it is undecorated,  
\[and\] we do not see muddy roads  
\[when they\] have not been cleaned,[^45] Great Sage. (38) \[1153\]

When we were living in the house,  
we were respected all the time;  
they’re always bringing everything,  
through the strength of our past karma.[^46] (39) \[1154\]

After abandoning \[our\] homes,  
going forth into homelessness,  
we have crossed the road of rebirth;[^47]  
we have become free of passion.[^48] (40) \[1155\]

All the time they are bringing us  
monastic robes and alms to eat,  
requisites \[as well as\] lodgings,  
by the thousands and more and more.[^49] (41) \[1156\]

Our defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
we are living without constraint. (42) \[1157\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for us.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[we have\] done what the Buddha taught! (43) \[1158\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[we have\] done what the Buddha taught! (44) \[1159\]

Thus indeed Eighty-Four Thousand Brahmin Maiden Buddhist Nuns spoke these verses.
