*\[12. Salalapupphikā*[^1]*\]*  
On Candabhāgā River’s bank,  
I was a *kinnarī* back then.  
And then I saw the God of Gods,  
Bull of Men, walking back and forth. (1) \[151\]

Plucking a *salala* \[flower,\]  
I gave it to the Best Buddha.  
\[And then\] the Great Hero did sniff  
the *salala* with divine scent. (2) \[152\]

Accepting \[it\] the Sambuddha,  
Vipassi, Leader of the World,  
Great Hero then sniffed \[it again\]  
\[for me\] while I was watching \[him\]. (3) \[153\]

Pressing my hands together then,  
I worshipped the Best of Bipeds.  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart,  
I then ascended the mountain. (4) \[154\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that flower back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (5) \[155\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (6) \[156\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[157\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[158\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Salalapupphikā spoke these verses.  
The legend of Salalapupphikā Therī is finished.  
[^1]: “Salala-Flower-er”. PTS reads *saḷala. *
