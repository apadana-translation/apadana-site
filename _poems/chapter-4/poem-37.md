*\[37. Aḍḍhakāsikā*[^1]*\]*

In this \[present\] lucky aeon,

Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,

\[the Buddha\] known as Kassapa[^2]

was born, the Best of Debaters. (1) \[1271\]

At that time, having been ordained

in that Buddha’s dispensation,

I’m restrained in the five senses,

and in monastic discipline.[^3] (2) \[1272\]

Moderate[^4] in eating, I was

committed to being watchful,[^5]

dwelling fixed on practice. One time

\[however,\] with a filthy mind,

I slandered an undefiled[^6] nun

\[by saying,\] “\[She’s\] a prostitute.”

Because of that evil karma,

I roasted in a \[fearful\] hell. (3-4) \[1273-1274\]

Due to the rest of that karma,

I was born in a clan of whores,

repeatedly committing sins;

and \[then\] in \[my\] final rebirth, (5) \[1275\]

I’m born among the Kāsians,[^7]

in a millionaire’s clan. Due to[^8]

\[former\] celibacy I was

gorgeous,[^9] like a nymph among gods. (6) \[1276\]

Seeing my extreme beauty, in

Rajgir, best city, they made \[me\]

enter prostitution due to[^10]

\[my\] formerly having slandered. (7) \[1277\]

After hearing the good Teaching

which was preached by the Best Buddha,

endowed with former impressions,

I went forth into homelessness. (8) \[1278\]

Seeking[^11] ordination[^12] having

gone into the Victor’s presence,

hearing[^13] that rogues were on[^14] the road,

I got ordained by messenger.[^15] (9) \[1279\]

All \[my\] karma has been burnt up,

merit and likewise evil too;

birth and rebirth[^16] crossed beyond,

and prostitution’s thrown away. (10) \[1280\]

I’ve mastered the superpowers

\[like\] the “divine ear” element.

I’m also a master, Great Sage,

of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (11) \[1281\]

I remember \[my\] former lives;

\[my\] “divine eye” is purified.

All the defilements are destroyed;

\[I\] will not be reborn again. (12) \[1282\]

In meaning and in the Teaching,

etymology and preaching,

\[this\] knowledge of mine was produced

in your presence, O Great Hero. (13) \[1283\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (14) \[1284\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (15) \[1285\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (16) \[1286\]

Thus indeed the bhikkhunī Aḍḍhakāsikā spoke these verses.

The legend of Aḍḍhakāsikā Therī[^17] is finished

[^1]: “Half a Benares Thousand \[Whore\],” “She \[Whose Daytime Price\]
    is Half a Benares Thousand,” as historical nun, remembered as the
    precedent for the giving of ordination by messenger. See DPPN I:50.
    Here the ordination is specifically called *upasampadā*, “higher
    ordination”

[^12]: PTS reads *tadā ‘pasampadatthāya,* with incorrect *sandhi*; BJTS
    reads, correctly, *tatopasampadatthāya,* cf. PTS alt. (also correct)
    *tad’ upa°*

[^13]: reading *sutvā* with BJTS for PTS *disvā* (“seeing”). Neither
    edition indicates variance in its reading of the verb.
