*\[10. Udakadāyikā*[^1]*\]*  
In the city, Bandhumatī,  
I was a water-fetcher then.  
Living by carrying water,  
I’m raising \[my\] children that way.[^2] (1) \[116\]

“I lack the things to be given  
in the unsurpassed merit-field.”  
Going to a water-tower,[^3]  
I supplied \[the Buddha\][^4] water. (2) \[117\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\].  
There I had a well-made mansion  
fashioned by carrying water.[^5] (3) \[118\]

I am surrounded all the time  
by a thousand celestial nymphs,  
\[and\] I always am surpassing  
all of them in \[all\] the ten ways.[^6] (4) \[119\]

I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of fifty kings among the gods.  
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of twenty kings who turned the wheel. (5) \[120\]

Transmigrating in two stations,  
the human or else the divine,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving water. (6) \[121\]

On a mountain top or bad road,  
up in the air and on the ground,  
whenever I desire water,  
I receive \[it\] very quickly. (7) \[122\]

In times of drought \[my\] region’s not  
scorched by the heat nor boiling hot;  
discerning what I am thinking  
a great rain-cloud \[always\] rains forth. (8) \[123\]

Whenever I am sent \[somewhere,\]  
with my assembly of kinsfolk,  
if I am wishing for \[some\] rain  
a great rain-cloud is then produced. (9) \[124\]

Being burned or having fever  
don’t \[ever\] affect my body;[^7]  
on my body there is no dust:  
that’s the fruit of giving water. (10) \[125\]

Today with \[my\] mind purified  
the evil-minded one is gone.  
All \[my\] defilements are destroyed;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (11) \[126\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving water. (12) \[127\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (13) \[128\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[129\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (15) \[130\]

Thus indeed Bhikhhunī Udakadāyikā spoke these verses.  
The legend of Udakadāyikā Therī is finished.  
The Summary:

Dīpad-Odakadā also;  
the verses here[^8] are counted \[thus:\]

The Sumedhā Chapter, the First

[^1]: “Water-Giver”

[^2]: lit., “by means of that” or “through that”.

[^3]: in the *Vinaya* and *Jātaka* this term, *koṭṭhaka,* refers to the place where monks kept water for bathing. In *Therāpadāna* (v. \[722\]) the term refers to a building in a monastery, and I have translated “storage room” accordingly. In the compound *dvārakoṭṭhaka* (v. \[531\] \[540\]) it refers to part of a city’s defenses, and following the cty I translate the compound “gateways with pillars and strongholds” (\[531\]) or “gateways and strongholds” (\[540\], where the *esikā* \[ornamental city\] pillar is singled out in a separate analogy. Here the term clearly refers to something that contains water, so I have translated it “water-tower” even though it may be more akin to “water-room” (as in *Vinaya* and *Jātaka*) or “water-stronghold” (as in this *Therāpadāna* usage).

[^4]: since this was ninety-one aeons ago, the Buddha was presumably Vipassi.

[^5]: that is, created as a result of the merit of having brought water to the Buddha.

[^6]: lit., “in \[all\] ten places”. Reading *dasaṭṭhānehi tā sabbā* (BJTS) for *dasaṭṭhāne hitā sabbā* (“all standing in ten places,” PTS). For a list of the ten ways of outshining the other women (there as *dasa-h-aṅgehi,* lit., “ten parts” or “ten limbs”) see below, v. \[333\]-\[335\] (= *Gotamī-apadāna* v. 107-109).

[^7]: reading *sarīre me na vijjati* (BJTS, PTS alt) for *atha m’eva na vijjati* (“are not ever seen by me,” PTS).

[^8]: reading *iha* (BJTS) for *viha* (PTS).
