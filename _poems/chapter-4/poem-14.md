### \[14. Ekāsanadāyikā[^1]\]

In the city, Haṃsavatī,  
I was a garland-maker then.  
My mother and my father too  
went off to work \[every day then\]. (1) \[166\]

When the sun was high in the sky,[^2]  
I saw a \[Buddhist\] monk \[just then,\]  
who was going along the road,  
\[so\] I spread out a seat \[for him\]. (2) \[167\]

Preparing that seat with woolen  
rugs with fleece and decorations,[^3]  
happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I \[then\] spoke these words \[to that monk\]: (3) \[168\]

“The ground is scorched \[and\] boiling hot;  
the sun is at its midday high;[^4]  
the breezes are not blowing \[now\];  
the time is right to come sit down.[^5] (4) \[169\]

This seat \[already\] is prepared  
\[just\] for your sake, o sage so great;  
having taken pity \[on me,\]  
\[please\] sit down on this seat of mine.” (5) \[170\]

The monk, well-tamed, with a pure mind,  
did sit down there \[at my request\].  
Having taken his begging bowl,  
I gave as much as it would hold.[^6] (6) \[171\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (7) \[172\]

There my well-made divine mansion,  
well-fashioned by \[giving that\] seat,  
welled up \[full\] sixty leagues in height,  
\[and was\] thirty leagues wide \[back then\]. (8) \[173\]

There were diverse couches for me,  
made of gold and made of silver,  
likewise \[some\] were made of crystal,  
and also made out of ruby. (9) \[174\]

My couch was well-spread with cushions,  
covered with embroidered wool rugs  
and coverlets of silk with gems,  
as well as \[some\] of fur with fringe.[^7] (10) \[175\]

Whenever I desire a trip,  
filled with laughter and amusement,  
I am going with the best couch,  
\[in accordance with\] my wishes. (11) \[176\]

I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of eighty kings among the gods.  
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of seventy wheel-turning kings. (12) \[177\]

Transmigrating from birth to birth,  
I \[always\] obtained great riches.  
There was no lack in terms of wealth:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] one seat. (13) \[178\]

Transmigrating in two stations,  
the human or else the divine,  
I did not know another state:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] one seat. (14) \[179\]

I am reborn in \[just\] two castes,[^8]  
kṣatriyan, or else a brahmin.  
Everywhere I’m of high family:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] one seat. (15) \[180\]

I know no mental turbulence,  
\[nor\] is my heart tormented \[then\].  
I \[also\] know no ugliness:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] one seat. (16) \[181\]

Wet-nurses are waiting on me,  
\[and\] many hump-backed servant-women;[^9]  
I am going from lap to lap:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] one seat. (17) \[182\]

Other people bathe and feed me,  
and \[they\] fondle me every day.  
Others anoint me with perfumes:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] one seat. (18) \[183\]

When I dwell in an empty room,  
a pavilion, beneath a tree,  
discerning what I am thinking,  
a couch is \[then\] produced \[for me\]. (19) \[184\]

Now it is my final lifetime,  
turning in my last existence.  
Even today, breaking my reign,[^10]  
I went forth into homelessness. (20) \[185\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave \[him\] that gift back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] one seat. (21) \[186\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (22) \[187\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (23) \[188\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (24) \[189\]

Thus indeed Venerable[^11] Bhikkhunī Ekāsanadāyikā spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekāsanadāyikā Therī is finished.

[^1]: “One-Chair-Donor”.

[^2]: lit., “in the midday sun”

[^3]: lit., “woolen rugs with long fleece \[and\] woolen rugs with embroidered designs”.

[^4]: lit., “the midday sun is fixed \[in the sky\]”

[^5]: lit., “this is a suitable time for coming to that \[seat\]”

[^6]: lit., “according to the \[size of the\] cavity”. Or perhaps we should read, “as much as \[I had\] cooked,” from *randheti*?

[^7]: lit., “and \[coverlets of\] fur \[or wool\] sticking up on one end” (*uddhaŋ-ekanta-lomī <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>a*).

[^8]: or families or clans (*kule*).

[^9]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reads *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>elāvikā* (fr. *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ela*, “cloth”? Diaper-washers? The tradition itself is unsure, with equally obscure alternates in <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> \[velāyikā, ve<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cheyikā\] and <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> \[*velāpikā, velāyikā*; <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads, equally obscurely and perhaps without mss. basis, *kheḷasikā\])*. The texts are in more agreement about the first part of the compound (sometimes as a separate adjective,) *khujjā*, “having a humped back,” though <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> records an alternate for that too (*bujjā*, an easy orthographical mistake). Mrs. Lily De Silva pointed out to me (personal communication) that in ancient India deformed people were often employed as servants, and the hump-backed servant woman has obvious parallels in Sanskrit literature (e.g., Mantharā \[Kūnī\], the hump-backed servant-woman of Queen Kaikeyī who convinces the latter to have Rāma banished, in the Hindu epic *Rāmāyana*).

[^10]: the same phrase, *rajjaṃ chaḍetvā*, appears above, in *Therī-apadāna* v. \[133\], too. It literally means “having broken/cut off the kingdom/kingship/rulership/rule.” The meaning is that a ruling monarch somehow abandons his (or in this case her) own kingship/queenship to take on the religious life. Here we might translate, “Even today, having abdicated queenship, I have gone forth…”

[^11]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> omits *āyasmā*.
