### \[16. Sālamālikā[^1]\]

On <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andabhāgā River’s bank,  
I was a *kinnarī* back then.  
I saw the Stainless One, Buddha,  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One. (1) \[215\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
awe-struck,[^2] with hands pressed together,  
taking a *sal*[^3]\[-flower\] garland,  
I worshipped the Self-Become One. (2) \[216\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (3) \[217\]

I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of thirty-six kings of the gods.  
Whatever my mind wishes for,  
comes into being as desired. (4) \[218\]

I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of ten kings who were wheel-turners.  
Being a good-minded woman,  
I transmigrated through lifetimes. (5) \[219\]

My wholesomeness is apparent;  
I went forth into homelessness.  
Today I’m worthy of *pūjā*  
in the Buddha’s[^4] dispensation. (6) \[220\]

Today, with \[my\] mind purified,  
the evil-minded one is gone.  
All \[my\] defilements are destroyed;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (7) \[221\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (8) \[223\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[224\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[225\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I worshipped the Buddha back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a *sal*[^5]-garland. (11) \[222\][^6]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
All \[my\] defilements are destroyed;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (12)  
Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Sālamālikā[^7] spoke these verses.

The legend of Sālamālikā[^8] Therī is finished.
