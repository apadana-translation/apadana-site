*Ekūposathikā Chapter, the Second*  
*\[11. Ekūposathikā*[^1]*\]*  
In the city, Bandhumatī,  
there was a king[^2] named Bandhuma.[^3]  
On the day of the full moon, he  
took on[^4] Full-Moon-Day observance.[^5] (1) \[131\]

At that time \[I also lived\] there;  
I was a water-jug slave-girl.  
Seeing the army, with the king,  
I reflected in this way then: (2) \[132\]

The king himself, breaking his reign,  
took on Full-Moon-Day observance.  
Surely that karma’s bearing fruit:  
the populace is delighted. (3) \[133\]

Having considered thoroughly  
my bad rebirth and poverty,  
after gladdening \[my\] mind, I  
took on Full-Moon-Day observance. (4) \[134\]

Having observed the Full Moon Day  
in the Buddha’s[^6] dispensation,  
Due to that karma done very well,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (5) \[135\]

There my well-made divine mansion  
welled up an \[entire\] league in height,  
appointed with fine gabled cells,  
decorated with large couches. (6) \[136\]

A \[whole\] lakh of celestial nymphs  
are always looking after me.  
Having surpassed the other gods,  
I outshine them all of the time. (7) \[137\]

I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of sixty-four kings of the gods.  
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of sixty-three wheel-turning kings. (8) \[138\]

Having a golden complexion,  
I transmigrated through lifetimes.  
Everywhere I am distinguished:  
fruit of Full-Moon-Day observance. (9) \[139\]

Elephant and horse carriages,  
and complete chariot riggings;  
I obtain every one of those:  
fruit of Full-Moon-Day observance. (10) \[140\]

Things made of gold, things of silver,  
also things made out of crystal,  
and likewise made of ruby too;  
I obtain all of those \[fine things\]. (11) \[141\]

Silken garments and woolen ones,  
clothes made of *khoma* and cotton,  
and \[other\] very costly clothes;  
I obtain all of those \[fine things\]. (12) \[142\]

Food and drinks and solid foodstuffs,  
and likewise clothing, beds and chairs;  
I would obtain all those \[items\]:  
fruit of Full-Moon-Day observance. (13) \[143\]

Superb scents as well as garlands,  
\[facial\] powders and ointments too;  
I would obtain all that \[make-up\]:  
fruit of Full-Moon-Day observance. (14) \[144\]

Gabled cell-\[adorned\] palaces,  
pavilions, storied mansions, caves;  
I would obtain all those \[dwellings\]:  
fruit of Full-Moon-Day observance. (15) \[145\]

\[When\] I was \[but\] seven years old,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
When the eighth month \[thence\] had arrived,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (16) \[146\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
All \[my\] defilements are destroyed;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (17) \[147\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
fruit of Full-Moon-Day observance. (18) \[148\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (19) \[149\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (20) \[150\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Ekūposathikā spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ekūposathikā Therī is finished.  
[^1]: “One Full-Moon-Day Observance-er”. *Uposatha* is a technical term
    for the weekly “sabbath” rituals according to the lunar calendar.
    These rites -- on the day of the new moon, the full moon, the waning
    moon and no moon -- became ubiquitous in the early centuries of the
    Buddhist era (and these “sabbaths” were observed by non-Buddhist
    groups as well). Among Buddhists, monks and nuns would meet for
    chanting of the monastic discipline and other rites of the assembly
    (*sanghakamma*), and would preach to and perform rituals for
    laypeople, especially devout *upāsakas* (male) and *upāsikās*
    (female) who on that day would adopt three more stringent
    disciplinary precepts in addition to the usual five precepts,
    spending the day living as quasi-monastics. This is what King
    Bandhumā is here credited with establishing, and what the rebirth
    precursor of Ekūposathikā did as the foundation of her future
    arahantship.  
[^2]: lit., “a kṣatriyan”.  
[^3]: the wife of this king also planted the seeds for arahantship (as
    Ekapiṇḍadāyikā) in the time of Gotama Buddha. See above,
    *Therī-apadāna* v. \[46\].  
[^4]: lit., “set up,” “arranged for” “produced” “was born in”. The verb
    (*upapajjati*) is used throughout *Apadāna* to mean “rebirth,”
    implying that taking on the Uposatha observance was considered a
    sort of new birth of the person who did it.  
[^5]: lit., “he set up the \[observance of\] Uposatha.”  
[^6]: lit., “Supreme Buddha’s”
