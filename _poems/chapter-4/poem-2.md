# The Legends of the Therīs

Now listen to the legends of the Therīs[^1]:

## Sumedhā Chapter, the First

### \[1. Sumedhā[^2]\]

When Koṇāgamana, Blessed One  
was in his new dwelling, a monastic ashram[^3]  
\[we\] who were three female friends \[then\]  
donated a monastery.[^4] (1) \[1\]

Ten times \[and then\] a hundred times  
and then a hundred hundred times[^5]  
we were reborn among the gods.  
Who could tell the human rebirths? (2) \[2\]

Among gods we had vast power;  
who could tell the human \[power\]?  
Chief queen of a seven-gemmer,[^6]  
I was[^7] the gem of a woman. (3) \[3\]

Here with wholesome \[karma\] heaped up[^8]  
\[we’re\] people from successful clans:  
Dhanañjānī and Khemā too  
along with me, the women three. (4) \[4\]

Making that hermitage well-made  
with every part \[of it\] adorned,  
delighted we donated \[it\]  
to the Buddha-led assembly.[^9] (5) \[5\]

In whichever place I’m reborn  
in accordance with[^10] that karma,  
among the gods and humans too  
I attain the foremost station. (6) \[6\]

In this \[present\] lucky aeon,  
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,  
\[the Buddha\] known as Kassapa[^11]  
was born, the Best of Debaters. (7) \[7\]

The attendant of the Great Sage  
was the ruler of men back then,  
the king of Kāsi, named Kiki,  
in Benares, greatest city. (8) \[8\]

That \[ruler\] had seven daughters  
royal maidens raised in comfort.  
Fond of waiting on the Buddha  
they practiced the religious life.[^12] (9) \[9\]

Being the ally of those \[girls\],  
steadfast in the moral precepts,  
giving gifts \[very\] carefully  
I practiced vows while in the house.(10) \[10\]

Due to that karma so well done,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (11) \[11\]

Fallen thence, I went to Yāma,[^13]  
\[and\] then I went to Tusita,  
and then to Nimmānarati  
and then Vāsavatti city. (12) \[12\]

In whichever place I’m reborn  
steadfast in \[doing\] good karma,[^14]  
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of the kings in all those \[heavens\]. (13) \[13\]

Fallen then into humanness,  
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of kings who turned the wheel \[of law\]  
and kings \[commanding\] large regions.[^15] (14) \[14\]

Having experienced happiness  
among gods and also humans,  
being comfortable everywhere  
I traveled on[^16] through several births. (15) \[15\]

That \[gift’s\][^17] the reason, that’s the cause,  
the root, the patience for the teaching,  
the first identification,[^18]  
this lover of Dhamma’s nirvana. (16) \[16\][^19]

\[My\] defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (17) \[17\]

Being in the Best Buddha’s midst  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (18) \[18\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (19) \[19\]

Thus indeed Venerable[^20] Bhikkhunī Sumedhā spoke these verses.

\[The legend of Sumedhā Therī is finished.\][^21]

[^1]: this command (in the second person imperative plural) is omitted by BJTS even though it gives the parallel commands in the verse (1) \[5\] of *Buddha-apadāna* and at the beginning of *Paccekabuddha-apadāna* and *Thera-apadāna*. The cty omits the Therīs altogether, despite having defined *Apadāna,* in its *nidāna,* as constituted by Buddha, Paccekabuddha, Thera and Therī sections.

[^2]: “Very Wise Woman”

[^3]: lit., “a hermitage for the Assembly,” “a monastic hermitage”. These two feet are oddly out of meter with the rest of this text (and nearly the whole *Apadāna*); rather than eight syllables, the first foot contains nine, and the second foot contains eleven syllables, as though the author decided half-way through the first verse to refrain from adopting a more elegant meter in favor of matching the meter in what had come before, with very few exceptions, in the parallel *Thera-apadāna.* But cf notes to *Therāpadāna* verses \[288\], \[359\] and \[362\] for exceptions to this statement (though not an exact meter-match).

[^4]: lit., “gave a *vihāra*-*dāna* \[=monastery-gift\]”.

[^5]: BJTS reads a 14-syllable first foot and an 8-syllable second one, lit., “ten times, hundred times, thousand times, hundred times hundred times”. It also reads *mānusake* for *mānuse* (PTS) to produce a nine-syllable fourth foot. Both texts provide nine-syllable first, third and fourth feet in the following verse (3), before finally settling in to the standard 8-8-8-8. See n. 4 above. Are these problems with the transmission, or experiments with (or heedlessness about) meter?

[^6]: here the “seven gems” (*sattaratana*) of a wheel-turning monarch (*cakkavatti*) have become an independent designation of the latter, perhaps better translated as “chief queen of a possessor of the seven gems” (or, metrically, “a seven-gem-holder’s chief queen”. Note that she is one of those seven gems, as stated in the next foot.

[^7]: reading *āsiṃ* (BJTS) for *bhaviŋ* (PTS).

[^8]: reading *sañcitakusalā* (BJTS) for *sañcitā kusalaŋ* (PTS), though they amount to the same thing.

[^9]: lit., “to the assembly (*saṅgha,* the monks’ Assembly) headed up by the Buddha.

[^10]: reading *vāhasā* (BJTS) for *vahasā* (PTS).

[^11]: BJTS reads “Named Kassapa according to his Lineage (*gottena*)”

[^12]: lit., “they fared according to the Brahma-faring,” i.e., they led a celibate (*brahmacariya*) existence.

[^13]: Yāma, Tusita, Nimmānarati and Vāsavatti are all classes of deities = heavens in the Buddhist cosmology.

[^14]: lit., “meritorious (*puñña*) karma”.

[^15]: *Maṇḍalīnañ ca rājūnaṃ*

[^16]: Or “I transmigrated,” *saṃsāriṃ.*

[^17]: This follows the lead of the BJTS SInhala gloss, which understands the string of “that” pronouns to refer to the foundational gift of a *vihāra* that led to the aforementioned bliss in heavenly and human states.

[^18]: *Samodhānaṃ,* the term used in the *Jātaka* for the “identifications” the Buddha makes there between characters in the story and characters in his own present-day. Here, then, the claim seems to be that the gift of the *vihāra* is the first/earliest act of merit that Sumedhā is identified with/by. But the verse is quite difficult, and this translation is at best provisional.

[^19]: This verse has nine syllables in the second and fourth foot, rather than the expected eight, so I have translated accordingly.

[^20]: BJTS omits *āyasmā.*

[^21]: PTS omits this concluding line from the present *apadāna* but includes it in the subsequent ones. BJTS reading of the concluding line numbers each *apadāna* according to its place in the ten-poem “chapter,” hence this one reads, “The legend of Sumedhā Therī, the first”. I follow the PTS style.
