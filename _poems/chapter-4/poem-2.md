### \[2. Mekhalādāyikā[^1]\]

I had a stupa constructed[^2]  
for Siddhattha, the Blessed One.  
I gifted \[my\] waist ornament[^3]  
so the Teacher could be repaired.[^4] (1) \[20\]

When that great stupa was finished,  
I gave another ornament[^5]  
for the Sage, the Guide of the World,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands. (2) \[21\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave that waist-ornament then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of building stupas. (3) \[22\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[23\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[24\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[25\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Mekhalādāyikā Therī[^6] spoke these verses.

The legend of Mekhalādāyikā Therī is finished.

[^1]: “Waist-Ornament-Giver”. *Mekhala* or *mekhalikā* was an ornament worn by women on the waist, often made of precious metals and gems.

[^2]: reading *kārāpikā* (BJTS, PTS alt) for *kārāpitā* (“was built,” PTS)

[^3]: presumably a valuable *mekhala* which was then sold in order to pay for the repairs.

[^4]: lit., “for the sake of repairing of the Teacher.” Here the stupa *is* the Buddha.

[^5]: lit., “again I gave a waist-ornament”.

[^6]: BJTS, PTS alt omit *therī*.
