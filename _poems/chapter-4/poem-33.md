*\[33. Uppaladāyikā*[^1]*\]*  
In Aruṇavatī City,  
\[lived\] the kṣatriyan Aruṇa.  
I was \[then\] the wife of that king;  
in that place[^2] I was practicing.[^3] (1) \[1160\]

Gone off alone \[and\] sitting down,  
I then reflected \[on it\] like this:  
“there’s no good karma[^4] done by me  
to take along on my journey.[^5] (2) \[1161\]

Am I not then going to hell,  
burning red hot, very cruel,  
with a gruesome form, and bitter?  
For me there’s no doubt about that.” (3) \[1162\]

Having thought \[it through\] in that way.  
bringing pleasure to \[my own\] mind,  
after going up to the king,  
I spoke these words \[entreating him:\] (4) \[1163\]

“O king,[^6] we \[who are\] called “women”  
always follow behind \[our\] men.[^7]  
Give me a single Buddhist monk;  
I shall feed \[him,\] O kṣatriyan.” (5) \[1164\]

At that time the king gave to me  
a monk with senses \[well-\]controlled.  
After picking up his alms bowl,  
I filled \[it\] with exquisite[^8] food. (6) \[1165\]

Filling it with exquisite food,  
having removed a fine garment  
which was valued at a thousand,  
I gave it with a happy mind. (7) \[1166\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (8) \[1167\]

I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of one thousand kings of the gods.  
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of one thousand wheel-turning kings. (9) \[1168\]

\[There was also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting,[^9]  
\[and there was\] much other,[^10] varied  
fruit of that karma thereafter. (10) \[1169\]

I’m \[always\] blue lotus-colored,  
very beautiful, good-looking,  
a woman endowed in all parts,  
of noble birth \[and\] radiant.[^11] (11) \[1170\]

When \[my\] last rebirth was attained  
I was born in the Śākyan clan,  
leader of one thousand women  
\[attached\] to Suddhodana’s son.[^12] (12) \[1171\]

Becoming wearied in the home,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
Before the seventh night occurred[^13]  
I attained the Four \[Noble\] Truths. (13) \[1172\]

I cannot count \[the gifts received,\]  
monastic robes and alms to eat,  
requisites \[as well as\] lodgings:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] alms food.[^14] (14) \[1173\]

O Sage, recall the good karma,  
which formerly \[was done\] by me;  
much of mine has been sacrificed  
for the sake of you, Great Hero. (15) \[1174\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave that alms-giving back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] alms food.[^15] (16) \[1175\]

I transmigrate in \[just\] two states:  
as a goddess or a woman.  
I do not know other rebirths;  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] alms food. (17) \[1176\]

\[When human\] I‘m born in high clans,  
which have big[^16] halls, very wealthy;  
I do not witness lesser clans:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] alms food. (18) \[1177\]

Transmigrating life after life,  
incited by \[my\] wholesome roots,  
I do not see what does not please:  
fruit \[of deeds\] done with[^17] happy mind. (19) \[1178\]

I’ve mastered the superpowers  
\[like\] the “divine ear” element.  
I’m also a master, Great Sage,  
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (20) \[1179\]

I remember \[my\] former lives;  
\[my\] “divine eye” is purified.  
All the defilements are destroyed;  
\[I\] will not be reborn again. (21) \[1180\]

In meaning and in the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
\[this\] knowledge of mine was produced  
in your presence, O Great Hero. (22) \[1181\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (23) \[1182\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (24) \[1183\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (25) \[1184\]

Thus indeed the bhikkhunī Uppaladāyikā spoke these verses face to face
with the Blessed One.  
The legend of the bhikkhunī Uppaladāyikā is finished

[^1]: “Blue Lotus Giver”

[^2]: reading *ekajjhaṃ* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *ekaccaŋ*
    (“certain,” “definite”)

[^3]: reading *cārayām’ ahaṃ* with BJTS (and cf. PTS alts. here) for PTS
    *vādayām’ ahaŋ* (“I am singing” “I am making sound” “I am causing to
    be said”)

[^4]: *kusalaŋ,* lit., “wholesome deeds”

[^5]: PTS *kusalaŋ me kataŋ n’atthi ādāya gamiyam mama;* BJTS *ādāya
    gamanīyaṃ hi kusalaṃ natthi me kataṃ*

[^6]: *deva,* or “Lord,” lit., “god”

[^7]: or “always become victims of men,” reading *purisānugatā sadā*
    with BJTS for PTS *purisānaŋ bharā mayaŋ* (“we are burdens on men”
    or “we carry the burden of men,” perhaps playing with the common
    word for “wife” used in v. 1, *bhariyā*)*.* Given the second half of
    the verse, in either event she is asking her husband for permission
    to “adopt” a monk. In the BJTS reading she does this by stating that
    as a woman she has not been able to do her own good deeds, always
    following after her men when they do their good deeds (and gain the
    merit; the whole question of women’s roles in the production of
    men’s karma peppers the *Therī-apadāna* despite its virtual absence
    in the corresponding *Thera-apadāna).* In the PTS reading, she sets
    up her request for the monk to feed either by apologizing for being
    a burden, or by pointing out that as one accustomed to carrying the
    burden of men she will be able to carry that of the monk, now
    requested.

[^8]: *parama,* or “supreme” “ultimate” “best” “superior”

[^9]: this refrain, common in *Thera-apadāna*, appears only here, and
    obviously lifted, in *Therī-apadāna*

[^10]: reading *aññaṃ* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *puññaŋ*
    (“merit”), though the latter is presumably the “other fruit” which
    the former reading implies

[^11]: or “effulgent,” *jutindharā*

[^12]: i.e., attached to (attending on) the bodhisattva Siddhartha;
    women of the royal harem of the becoming-Buddha.

[^13]: lit., “the seventh night not attained”

[^14]: *piṇḍapātass’ idaŋ phalaŋ*

[^15]: *piṇḍapātass’ idaŋ phalaŋ*

[^16]: reads *mahā°* with BJTS for *tayo°* (“three”). The latter is
    possible, but a weird departure from what is a stock phrase
    elsewhere in *Apadāna*

[^17]: lit., “of”
