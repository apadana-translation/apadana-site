*\[5. Tīṇinaḷamālikā*[^1]*\]*  
On Candabhāgā River’s bank,  
I was a *kinnarī* back then.[^2]  
I saw the Stainless Buddha \[there\],  
Self-Become, the Unconquered One. (1) \[37\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
awe-struck,[^3] with hands pressed together,  
taking a garland made of reeds,  
I worshipped the Self-Become One. (2) \[38\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
I went to the Thirty-Three \[Gods\].[^4]  
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of thirty-six kings of the gods. (3) \[39-40\]  
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of ten kings who were wheel-turners.  
My heart being agitated,[^5]  
I went forth into homelessness. (4) \[40\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
existence has been slain for me.[^6]  
All \[my\] defilements are destroyed;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (5) \[42\][^7]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (6) \[41\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (7) \[43\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[44\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[45\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Tīṇinaḷamālikā spoke these verses.  
The legend of Tīṇinaḷamālikā Therī is finished.  
[^1]: BJTS omits *Tīṇī°.* The name means “\[Three\] (or perhaps we
    should read *tiṇī,* \[Grass\]) Reed Garland-er”.  
[^2]: see note to *Therāpadāna* v. \[1886\]

[^3]: *vedajāto*  
[^4]: lit., “I went to the Group of Thirty-Three”. BJTS reads “Due to
    that karma \[so\] well done, with intention and \[firm\] resolve,
    leaving \[my\] *kinnarī* body, I was born \[with\] the
    Thirty-Three,” and places the last two feet of the verse at the
    beginning of the next one.  
[^5]: reading *saṃvejetvāna me cittaṃ* (BJTS, PTS alt) for *saṃvedayitvā
    kusalaṃ* (“having felt/experienced \[my\] wholesome \[karma\],”
    PTS).  
[^6]: BJTS reads “all \[new\] existence is destroyed.”  
[^7]: BJTS inverts the order of verses (5) and (6).
