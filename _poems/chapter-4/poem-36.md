*\[36. Abhirūpanandā*[^1]*\]*  
Ninety-one aeons ago the  
Leader, whose name was Vipassi,  
arose, the One Good to Look At,[^2]  
the One with Eyes for Everything. (1) \[1246\]  
I was then in Bandhumatī,  
born in a large clan, prosperous  
\[and\] rich; beautiful and held dear,  
I am worshipped[^3] by[^4] the people. (2) \[1247\]  
Having approached the Great Hero,  
Vipassi, Leader of the World,  
hearing the Teaching, I went for  
refuge \[in\] the Leader of Men. (3) \[1248\]  
Having been restrained in morals,  
when the Best Man[^5] reached nirvana,  
I offered[^6] a gold umbrella  
on top of the relic-stupa. (4) \[1249\]  
I’m freely generous, moral  
as long as life; fallen from there,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (5) \[1250\]  
In ten ways I was outshining  
\[all the\] other \[gods who lived there\]:  
through shapes \[and\] sounds \[and\] fragrances,  
through tastes and the \[things that I\] touch, (6) \[1251\]  
in terms of lifespan, complexion,  
happiness and famousness too  
\[and\] likewise through supreme power  
I shone, having attained \[those ten\]. (7) \[1252\]  
And now, in \[my\] final rebirth,  
I’m born in Kapilavastu.[^7]  
I’m well-known \[by the\] name Nandā,  
the Śākyan Khemaka’s daughter. (8) \[1253\]  
The nickname[^8] “Very Beautiful”[^9]  
indicated my loveliness;[^10]  
when I had attained discretion,  
\[I’m\] adorned with gorgeous beauty.[^11] (9) \[1254\]  
Then there was a very big fight[^12]  
over me[^13] among the Śākyans.  
Then \[my\] father had me ordained,  
“don’t let the Śākyas be destroyed.”[^14] (10) \[1255\]  
Going forth like that, having heard  
that the Supreme Man hates[^15] beauty,  
I did not approach \[the Buddha,\]  
bring proud about my beauty. (11) \[1256\]  
Not even going for advice,  
I’m afraid to see the Buddha.  
Then the Victor had me led to  
his presence by means of a trick. (12) \[1257\]  
Clever in the Path, \[the Buddha\]  
made three \[different\] women appear  
with forms like celestial nymphs:  
\[one\] young, \[one\] diseased, \[the third\] dead. (13) \[1258\]  
Seeing them, very moved, I was  
freed from delighting in bodies.  
I stood \[there,\] weary of being,  
then the Leader said \[this\] to me: (14) \[1259\]  
“Nandā, see this complex heap[^16] as  
diseased, disgusting \[and\] putrid.  
It is oozing and it’s dripping,  
the delight of foolish people. (15) \[1260\]  
With one-pointed focus, steadfast,  
fix your mind on impurity.  
Just as is this, so too is that;  
just as is that, so too is this. (16) \[1261\]  
Considering that in this way,  
industrious by night and day,  
you will see with your own wisdom,  
having turned away in disgust.” (17) \[1262\]  
Not delaying in that \[purpose,\]  
thinking[^17] \[it all\] through thoroughly,  
I saw this body as it is,  
on the inside and the outside. (18) \[1263\]  
Then I’m disgusted with bodies,  
and inwardly free of passion;  
not negligent, no longer yoked,  
at peace, and \[I’ve reached\] nirvana. (19) \[1264\]  
I’ve mastered the superpowers  
\[like\] the “divine ear” element.  
I’m also a master, Great Sage,[^18]  
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (20) \[1265\]  
I remember \[my\] former lives;  
\[my\] “divine eye” is purified.  
All the defilements are destroyed;  
\[I\] will not be reborn again. (21) \[1266\]  
In meaning and in the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
\[this\] knowledge of mine was produced  
in your presence, O Great Hero. (22) \[1267\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (23) \[1268\]  
Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (24) \[1269\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (25) \[1270\]  
Thus indeed the bhikkhunī Abhirūpanandā spoke these verses.  
The legend of Abhirūpanandā Therī[^19] is finished  
[^1]: “Very Beautiful Joy,” an historical nun, DPPN I:143. On these
    various “Joys” (of whom Malalasekera’s designations may need further
    work) see above, the first note to *Therī-apadāna* \#25.  
[^2]: *carunayano*  
[^3]: reading *pūjanīyā* with BJTS for PTS sajanassā  
[^4]: lit., of (gen. pl.), lit., “the people’s object to be worshipped”  
[^5]: *nibbute ca naruttame*  
[^6]: lit., “did *pūjā”*  
[^7]: *kapilavhaye,* lit., “in the \[city\] named for Kapila”  
[^8]: reading *upapadaṃ* (in the sense of “epithet”) with BJTS for PTS
    *uppādaŋ* (“birth” “omen”), which breaks meter.  
[^9]: *abhirūpaŋ*  
[^10]: reading *me kantisūcakaṃ* with BJTS for PTS *m’ ekaŋ ti sūcakaŋ*
    (?)  
[^11]: reading *rūpalāvaññabhusitā* with BJTS for PTS
    *rūpavaṇṇavibhusitā,* which however has much the same meaning.  
[^12]: or debate: *vivādo*  
[^13]: reading *tadā mamatthaṃ* (“for my sake,” i.e., over who will
    marry me) with BJTS for PTS *Idaŋ me-m’ atthe* (“this for the sake
    of me”?)  
[^14]: i.e., everyone wants Nandā so badly that the end result will be
    the ruin of the whole clan; her father takes her out of the
    competition to avoid the conflict it will generate  
[^15]: reading *rūpadessiṃ naruttamaṃ* with BJTS for PTS *rūpadassiŋ*
    (alt. *dassana*), “beautiful looking supreme man”  
[^16]: *samussayaŋ, “*conglomeration,” i.e., the body  
[^17]: or “dwelling” “practicing” “living” (BJTS: *viharantyā’dha
    yoniso*)  
[^18]: reading *mahāmune* (voc.) with BJTS for PTS *tadā muni* (“Then
    the Sage \[nom.\];” PTS alt. *tadā mune,* “Then, O Sage”)  
[^19]: this is the BJTS reading for PTS *bhikkhunī Abhirūpanandā*
