*\[29. Ten Thousand Buddhist Nuns Headed Up by Yasovatī*[^1]*\]*

One hundred thousand aeons \[and\]

four incalculable \[aeons\]

hence, Dīpaṅkara, the Victor,

the Leader of the World was born. (1) \[1029\]

Dīpaṅkara, the Great Hero,

the Guide, prophesied back then that

Sumedha and Sumittā would

be the same in pleasure and pain. (2) \[1030\]

Seeing and going about in

the world together with \[its\] gods,

meeting us was included in

\[what Buddha\] prophesied for them. (3) \[1031\]

“You,[^2] \[Sumedha,\] will be all of

our husbands met in the future;

we’ll all be your desirable

wives, saying what is dear \[to you\].” (4) \[1032\]

All this alms-giving and morals,

meditation cultivated;

for a long time our everything

has been abandoned, O Great Sage. (5) \[1033\]

Scents and ointments, garlands \[and\] lamps,

which were fashioned out of \[pure\] gold,

whatever it was we wished for,

all was abandoned, O Great Sage. (6) \[1034\]

And other karma \[we\] have done,

and \[every\] human enjoyment,

for a long time our everything

has been abandoned, O Great Sage. (7) \[1035\]

Transmigrating in varied births,

much good karma[^3] was done by us;

experiencing \[you as\] husband,

transmigrating life after life, (8) \[1036\]

When \[our\] last lifetime was attained,

in the home of the Śākyan prince,[^4]

we arose in various clans,

attractive celestial nymphs.[^5] (9) \[1037\]

We’ve attained fame, with foremost gain;

we’re worshipped[^6] and well-respected.

We are always venerated,

receiving things to eat and drink. (10) \[1038\]

After abandoning the home,

going[^7] forth into homelessness,

when eight months[^8] had not yet elapsed,

we all realized nirvana. (11) \[1039\]

Always worshipped \[and\] respected,

\[we\] receive things to eat and drink,

and clothes \[and also\] lodgings \[too;\]

\[folks\] bring \[us\] all the requisites. (12) \[1040\]

Our[^9] defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

we are living without constraint. (13) \[1041\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence

was a very good thing for us.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[we have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[1042\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[we have\] done what the Buddha taught! (15) \[1043\]

Thus indeed ten thousand Buddhist nuns headed up by Yasovatī spoke these
verses face-to-face with the Blessed One.

The legend of ten thousand Buddhist nuns headed up by Yasodharā is
finished

[^1]: BJTS reads “The *Apadāna* of Ten Thousand Buddhist Nuns”

[^2]: reading *hohi* with BJTS for PTS *honti* (they will be/they are)

[^3]: *puññaŋ,* lit., “merit”

[^4]: *°putta°* lit., “son”

[^5]: *accharā kāmavaṇṇinī*, lit., “having the desirable appearance
    \[like\] celestia nymphs”

[^6]: lit., “offered *pūjā*”

[^7]: reading *pabbajitvāna* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *pabbajiŋ*
    (“I went forth”)

[^8]: *aṭṭhamāse,* BJTS reads *addhamāse* (“half a month”)

[^9]: PTS just gives *pe* here, suggesting that the concluding refrain
    remains in the first person singular as elsewhere throughout the
    collection. BJTS however supplies the full verses, including the
    readings translated here, corrected for the plural subject.
