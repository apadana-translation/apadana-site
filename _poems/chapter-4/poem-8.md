### \[8. Sattuppalamālikāya[^1]\]

In Aruṇavatī City,  
lived a king[^2] named Aruṇavā.  
I was \[then\] the wife of that king,  
sent out \[by him\] on a journey.[^3] (1) \[71\]

Having taken seven flowers,  
divinely perfumed blue lotus,  
lying down in \[that\] fine palace,  
I reflected in this way then: (2) \[72\]

“What use are these flowers to me,[^4]  
planted on \[the top of\] my head?  
They’ll be better for me offered  
to the Best Buddha’s \[great\] knowledge. (3) \[73\]

They’re honoring the Sambuddha;  
Sitting near the \[palace\] doorway,  
when the Sambuddha arrives here,  
I \[too\] will worship the Great Sage.” (4) \[74\]

Splendid like an arjuna \[tree\],[^5]  
like a lion, the king of beasts,  
along with the monks’ Assembly,  
the Victor \[then\] came on the road. (5) \[75\]

After seeing the Buddha’s rays,  
happy, with a mind that was moved,  
having opened up the door, I  
\[then\] worshipped the Best of Buddhas. (6) \[76\]

I scattered up in the sky \[there\]  
those seven blue lotus flowers.  
\[Then\] covering the Buddha’s head,  
they were held up \[there in the sky\]. (7) \[77\]

Thrilled at heart, with a happy mind,  
awe-struck,[^6] with hands pressed together,  
bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart there,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (8) \[78\]

Blue lotus[^7]\[-flower\] canopies  
are carried on top of my head.  
I \[then\] exude divine perfumes:  
the fruit of seven lotuses. (9) \[79\]

Whenever I am sent \[somewhere\]  
with my assembly of kinsfolk,  
blue lotuses are carried then  
over my entire[^8] retinue. (10) \[80\]

I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of seventy kings of the gods.  
Everywhere a female ruler,  
I transmigrated birth to birth. (11) \[81\]

I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of sixty-three wheel-turning kings.  
They all conform to my \[wishes\];  
I’m one whose words are listened to.[^9] (12) \[82\]

My color and exuded scent  
are those of blue lotus flowers;  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (13) \[83\]

Skillful in the superpowers,  
fond of wisdom’s parts as focus,[^10]  
special knowledges perfected:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (14) \[84\]

Skilled in retaining mindfulness,[^11]  
pastured in calm-meditation,  
undertaking fit exertion:[^12]  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (15) \[85\]

My effort bearing the burden  
brought me release from attachments;[^13]  
defilements are all destroyed,  
now there will be no more rebirth. (16) \[86\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I worshipped \[him with that\] flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (17) \[87\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (18) \[88\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (19) \[89\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (20) \[90\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Sattuppalamālikāya spoke these verses.

The legend of Sattuppalamālikāya Therī[^14] is finished.
