*\[25. Nandā (Janapadakalyāṇi)*[^1]*\]*

The Victor, Padumuttara,

was a Master of Everything.

\[That\] Leader arose in the world

one hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[804\]

The Admonisher,[^2] Instructor,[^3]

Crosser-Over[^4] of all that breathe,

Skilled at Preaching,[^5] \[he\], the Buddha,

caused many folks to cross \[the flood\]. (2) \[805\]

Merciful,[^6] Compassionate One,[^7]

Well-Wisher[^8] of all that breathe, he

established in the five precepts

all the rivals who had arrived. (3) \[806\]

In this way he was Unconfused[^9]

and Very Well-Known[^10] by rivals,

Ornamented[^11] by arahants

who were masters \[and\] neutral ones. (4) \[807\]

The \[body of the\] Sage So Great

rose up fifty-eight cubits[^12] \[tall\];

he was Valuable Like Gold,[^13]

Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. (5) \[808\]

\[People’s\] lifespan at that time was

\[fully\] one hundred thousand years.

Remaining \[in the world\] so long,

he ferried many folks across. (6) \[809\]

I was born in Haṃsavatī,

in a clan of millionaires then,

glistening with various gems,

endowed with supreme happiness. (7) \[810\]

Having approached the Great Hero,

I heard \[him\] preaching the *Dhamma*,

ultimately sweet[^14] ambrosia[^15]

which makes known the ultimate truth. (8) \[811\]

Then after inviting \[him, the\]

Three-Worlds-Ender, with Assembly,

giving him a large almsgiving,

\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands,

bowing \[my\] head to the Hero,

the World’s Leader with Assembly,

I aspired to that foremost place

of Buddhist nuns who meditate. (9-10) \[812-813\]

Then the Untamed-Tamer,[^16] Master,[^17]

Refuge for the Three Worlds,[^18] \[Buddha,\]

the Leopard of Men,[^19] prophesied:

“you will receive that well-wished \[place\]. (11) \[814\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,

arising in Okkāka’s clan,

the one whose name is Gotama

will be the Teacher in the world. (12) \[815\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,

*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,

the one known by the name Nandā,

will be the Teacher’s follower.” (13) \[816\]

At that time being overjoyed,

as long as life, heart \[full of\] love,

I attended on the Victor,

the Guide, providing requisites. (14) \[817\]

Due to that karma done very well,

with intention and \[firm\] resolve,

discarding \[my\] human body,

I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (15) \[818\]

Fallen thence, I went to Yāma,[^20]

\[and\] then I went to Tusita,

and then to Nimmānarati,[^21]

and then Vāsavatti City. (16) \[819\]

In whichever place I’m reborn,

in accordance with that karma,

everyplace I was made chief queen

of \[the gods who were\] the kings \[there\]. (17) \[820\]

Fallen thence, in the human state,

\[everyplace\] I was made chief queen

of kings who turn the wheel \[of law,\]

and \[powerful\] regional kings. (18) \[821\]

Having experienced success,

among gods as well as humans,

becoming happy everywhere,

I transmigrated for aeons.[^22] (19) \[822\]

When \[my\] last rebirth was attained,

I was the blameless[^23] daughter of

King Suddhodana,[^24] \[living in\]

delightful[^25] Kapilavastu.[^26] (20) \[823\]

Seeing \[my\] splendor[^27] \[and\] beauty,

that \[Śākyan\] clan was rejoicing.[^28]

Therefore they gave the name “Nandā,”

pleasant \[and\] excellent, to me. (21) \[824\]

\[I was\][^29] renowned as “the Beauty”[^30]

among all of the young women

in that same[^31] delightful city,

except \[of course\] Yasodharā.[^32] (22) \[825\]

\[My\] eldest brother’s the Buddha,[^33]

the middle one’s[^34] likewise a saint;[^35]

staying alone in the lay life,

I am exhorted by mother:[^36] (23) \[826\]

“Child, you’re born in the Śākyan clan,

following after the Buddha.

Why do you sit[^37] \[there\] in the house,

being bereft of \[all your\] joy?[^38] (24) \[827\]

Thought impure[^39] is youthful beauty,[^40]

under the power of old age;

even a life which is healthy,

ends in disease, ends in dying. (25) \[828\]

Look at even your \[own\] fine form:

charming, distracting to the mind,[^41]

it’s adorned and ornamented

like[^42] Goddess Fortune embellished,[^43] (26) \[829\]

like concentrated[^44] world-essence[^45]

medicinal balm for the eyes,[^46]

generating praise for merit,[^47]

rejoicing the Okkāka clan; (27) \[830\]

in no long time at all, old age

is going to overpower \[it\].

Young one, abandoning the house,

choose[^48] the Teaching, O blameless one.” (28) \[831\]

After hearing \[my\] mother’s words,

I went forth into homelessness

in[^49] body, but not in \[my\] heart,

\[still\] enthralled by youth and beauty. (29) \[832\]

Mother[^50] said to make my basis[^51]

through study of the altered states,[^52]

\[pursuing it\] with great effort.

I was not enthused[^53] about that. (30) \[833\]

Then the Great Compassionate One

saw[^54] me enthralled by sense pleasures.

To make me[^55] weary of beauty,[^56]

through his own majestic power,

the Victor conjured up, in my

line of sight, a woman who shined;

she was gorgeous,[^57] truly brilliant,[^58]

even more beautiful than I. (31-32) \[834-835\]

And I, astonished, seeing her[^59]

very astonishing body,

thought \[to myself,\] “fruitful \[today\]

is the receipt of human eyes.” (33) \[836\]

I said to her, “O lucky one![^60]

Tell me the story how you’ve come,

and if you please, do tell to me

\[your\] clan, \[your\] name, \[your\] family.” (34) \[837\]

“No time for questions, lucky one;

let me lay \[my head\] in \[your\] lap.”[^61]

As though sinking[^62] into my limbs

she reclined well[^63] for a moment. (35) \[838\]

Then putting \[her\] head in my lap

she with lovely eyes stretched out \[there\].

A spider,[^64] very venomous,

landed on that \[woman’s\] forehead. (36) \[839\]

When \[it\] had fallen onto her,

boils formed \[all over her body\];

popping open, they were oozing

putrid \[chunks of\] pus mixed with blood. (37) \[840\]

And \[her\] face was disfigured too,

with the putrid stench of a corpse;

and \[her\] body festered[^65] too,

\[now\] swollen up and \[turning\] blue. (38) \[841\]

With all of her limbs quivering,

gasping for every breath she took,[^66]

making known her own suffering,

she piteously wailed \[like this:\] (39) \[842\]

“I’m afflicted with affliction,[^67]

feeling \[agonizing\] feelings;

I’m sunk down in great affliction.

Be a refuge for me, O friend.” (40) \[843\]

“Where is \[that\] facial shine of yours?

Where is your \[attractive\] long nose?

Your excellent copper-red lips?

Where has your \[beautiful\] face gone? (41) \[844\]

Where’s \[your\] mouth, shining like the moon?

Where has your conch-shell-shaped neck gone?

And \[both\] your ears, swaying like swings,[^68]

have \[now\] become \[badly\] discolored. (42) \[845\]

Your milk-laden \[breasts shaped\] like jugs

which resembled pointy \[young\] buds[^69]

have popped open; you’ve become a

putrid corpse with a horrid stench. (43) \[846\]

\[Your\] slender middle[^70] \[and\] buttocks,

meat-stall[^71] where wounds and sins[^72] are born

\[are now\] adorned with excrement.

O! Beauty is not eternal! (44) \[847\]

Every born body \[is the same:\]

putrid-smelling and frightening,

like a loathsome[^73] cemetery,

where \[only\] fools \[find their\] delight.” (45) \[848\]

Then the Great Compassionate One,

my brother, Leader of the World,

Having seen me, moved in \[my\] heart,

he spoke these verses \[to me then:\] (46) \[849\]

“Nanda, look at \[your own\] body,

\[also\] a sick \[and\] putrid corpse.

Through disgustingness cultivate

\[your\] mind, well-composed and tranquil. (47) \[850\]

Just as is this, so too is that;

just as is that, so too is this:

putrid \[and\] emitting a stench,

causing delight \[only\] to fools. (48) \[851\]

Considering that in this way,

industrious by day and night,

you will see with your own wisdom,

having turned away in disgust. (49) \[852\]

After that I was deeply moved,

having heard \[those\] well-said verses;

remaining there, being at peace,[^74]

I attained \[my\] arahantship. (50) \[853\]

Everyplace where I am seated,

I \[reach\] the highest altered states.

The Victor, pleased by \[my\][^75] virtue,

\[then\] placed me in that foremost place. (51) \[854\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (52) \[855\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (53) \[856\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (54) \[857\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Nandā spoke these verses.

The legend of Nandā Therī is finished.

[^1]: “Joy,” an historical nun, daughter of King Suddhodana and
    Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī (\#17, above), hence half-sister (plus, given
    that her mother was the Buddha’s mother’s sister) of the Buddha,
    remembered as foremost among those with meditative power.
    Malalasekera (DPPN II:1217) takes her as Sundarī Nandā, though there
    has been some confusion with the other Nandās among the famous nuns;
    “Janapadakalyāṇī” is also an epithet used for the Nandā caled
    Rūpanandā (DPPN I:934; II: 748) who also is said to be a “sister” of
    the Buddha. Cf. also in this mix Abhirūpanandā (DPPN I:143)

    gloss reading; I construe the epithet as *su* + *ñata*

    Padumuttara Buddha was 1044 inches (or 87 feet) tall.

    “like a gold festoon work”

[^15]: *amataŋ,* or “deathless”

[^16]: *adantadamako* could mean either “tamer of the untamed” or “tamer
    who is untamed;” I leave the ambiguity open with the hyphen,
    admitting here my preference for “tamer of the untamed” (which is
    also the BJTS reading, cf RD on *dametar*), and recommend
    pronunciation in chanting which through stress on the first term in
    the compound, and tone, can emphasize that the Buddha is one who
    tames those who are untamed/feral.

[^40]: *rūpaŋ*

[^41]: *manoharaŋ,* “delightful”

[^42]: BJTS reads *sasikantam* (?) for PTS *passa kantaŋ*, perhaps a

    gloss) for PTS *passajissaŋ* (? the side? “I will look at my
    limbs?”)

    sort of \[*lutā*, sic\]) for PTS *luddā* (“hunters” \[or
    “disgusting/gruesome thing” ?\])

[^65]: reading *vipubbañca* (“festering”) with BJTS for PTS *sabbañca*
    (“all” “entire”), though the latter is also a reasonable enough
    reading.

    apparent meaning

[^69]: especially the buds of *mimusops elengi* (says RD quoting Hardy,
    see *makuḷa* s.v.), = Spanish Cherry, Pāli *vakula.* This accepts
    the PTS reading here, *makul\[ḷ\]a-khārak’-ākārā*, recognizing that

    \[“resembling the buds of trees in water” (?)\])

    meaning (disgusting, horrible, dreadful)

[^74]: or, reading *vipassantī* with BJTS, “investigating” “applying
    insight”
