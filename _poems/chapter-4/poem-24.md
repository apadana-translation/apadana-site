*\[24. Sakulā*[^1]*\]*  
The Victor, Padumuttara,  
was a Master of Everything.  
\[That\] Leader arose in the world  
one hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[769\]  
For the benefit, happiness  
and profit of all beings, the  
Best Debater, Thoroughbred Man,[^2]  
came into[^3] \[the world\] with \[its\] gods. (2) \[770\]  
Foremost Fame-Attainer,[^4] Victor,  
Fortunate,[^5] Beautified by Praise,[^6]  
the Victor for the entire world,  
Widely-Known[^7] in[^8] all directions, (3) \[771\]  
the Uprooter of Doubt,[^9] the One  
who Passed Beyond Uncertainty,[^10]  
he with an Intention-Filled Mind,[^11]  
attained Supreme Awakening.[^12] (4) \[772\]  
Ultimate Man,[^13] Progenitor[^14]  
of the path that had yet to be,[^15]  
proclaimed \[that which was\] unproclaimed,  
produced \[that which was\] unproduced. (5) \[773\]  
Path-Knower,[^16] Path-Understander,[^17]  
Path-Proclaimer,[^18] the Bull of Men,  
Path-Skilled, the Teacher, \[the Buddha,\]  
was the Best of Charioteers.[^19] (6) \[774\]  
The Great Compassionate Teacher,  
the Leader was preaching *Dhamma,*  
lifting up \[all\] living beings  
sunk in the muck of delusion. (7) \[775\]  
I was born in Haṃsavatī,  
rejoicing \[all the\] kṣatriyans;[^20]  
I was then very beautiful,  
set for wealth,[^21] held dear, resplendent. (8) \[776\]  
I was the ravishing daughter  
of great king Ānanda and thus,  
sister by another mother[^22]  
of him named Padumuttara. (9) \[777\]  
Adorned in all \[my\] ornaments,  
along with the royal maidens,  
going up to the Great Hero,  
I heard \[him\] preaching the *Dhamma*. (10) \[778\]  
And then, amidst the multitudes,  
the Guru of the \[Whole\] World[^23] praised  
a Buddhist nun with “divine eye,”  
\[and\] placed her in that foremost place. (11) \[779\]  
I was happy having heard that;  
after giving the Teacher alms,  
and worshipping the Sambuddha,  
I aspired for the “divine eye.” (12) \[780\]  
And then the Teacher said to me:  
“Joyful one, that is well wished-for;  
you will receive \[as you\] aspire,  
fruit of alms for the *Dhamma-*Lamp.[^24] (13) \[781\]  
In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (14) \[782\]  
Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
the one whose name is Sakulā  
will be the Teacher’s follower.” (15) \[783\]  
Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (16) \[784\]  
In this \[present\] lucky aeon  
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,  
\[the Buddha\] known as Kassapa[^25]  
was born, the Best of Debaters. (17) \[785\]  
I was a mendicant back then,  
proceeding about on my own.  
While wandering around for alms,  
I received some[^26] sesame oil. (18) \[786\]  
Having lit a lamp with that \[oil,\]  
with a mind that was very clear,  
every night I attended on  
the shrine[^27] of the Best of Bipeds. (19) \[787\]  
Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (20) \[788\]  
In whichever place I’m reborn,  
in accordance with that karma,  
wherever I am wandering,  
when I’m gone there, there are large lamps. (21) \[789\]  
Through \[any\] wall, through \[any\] rock,  
going beyond a mountain \[top\],  
I \[can\] see whatever I wish:  
that is the fruit of giving lamps. (22) \[790\]  
I am \[someone who\] has pure eyes;  
I am blazing forth through \[my\] fame;  
I am faithful, wise and mindful:  
that is the fruit of giving lamps. (23) \[791\]  
And now, in \[my\] final rebirth,  
I am born in a brahmin clan,  
rich in grain and abundant wealth,  
joyful \[and\] honored[^28] by the king. (24) \[792\]  
I was complete in every part,[^29]  
adorned with all the ornaments.  
\[One time\] standing in a window,  
I saw the Well-Gone-One at the  
city gate, Blazing Forth through Fame,  
Honored by Gods and by People,  
Ornamented with the \[Great\] Marks,  
Endowed with \[Eighty\] Lesser Marks. (25-26) \[793-794\]  
Happy, with a heart that was thrilled,  
I chose \[to seek\] ordination.  
After not a very long time,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (27) \[795\]  
I’ve mastered the superpowers  
\[like\] the “divine ear” element.  
I know the hearts of others \[too,\]  
I have done what the Teacher taught.[^30] (28) \[796\]  
I remember \[my\] former lives;  
\[my\] “divine eye” is purified.  
Throwing off all the defilements,  
I am[^31] purified, \[I’m\] stainless. (29) \[797\]  
The Teacher’s been worshipped by me;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught.  
The heavy load has been laid down,  
the ties to existence severed. (30) \[798\]  
The reason for which I went forth,  
from \[my\] home into homelessness --  
I have \[now\] achieved that purpose:  
destruction of all the fetters. (31) \[799\]  
Then the Greatly Compassionate  
One placed me in \[that\] foremost place:  
The Supreme Man[^32] \[said,\] “Sakulā  
is foremost of ‘divine eye’ \[nuns.\]” (32) \[800\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (33) \[801\]  
Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (34) \[802\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (35) \[803\]  
Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Sakulā spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sakulā Therī is finished.
