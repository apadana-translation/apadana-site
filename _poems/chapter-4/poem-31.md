## Khattiyā Chapter,[^1] the Fourth

### \[31. Eighteen Thousand Kṣatriyan Maiden Buddhist Nuns Headed Up by Yasavatī[^2]\]

O Great Sage, we are announcing  
“all existence has been destroyed;”  
\[we’re\] freed from ties to existence  
all outflows[^3] don’t exist for us.[^4] (1) \[1104\]

Doing previous good[^5] karma,  
whatever may have been wished for,[^6]  
all of this stuff[^7] has been given  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage.[^8] (2) \[1105\]

The wishes of Buddhas, Lonely  
Buddhas and of the followers,  
\[all of\] this stuff[^9] has been given  
for the sake of you, O Great Sage.[^10] (3) \[1106\]

This karma, \[both\] big \[and\] little,  
excellent wish of Buddhist monks,  
\[and\] service to high-status clans  
has been done by us,[^11] O Great Sage.[^12] (4) \[1107\]

Incited by that wholesome root,  
reaping[^13] \[the fruit\] of that karma,  
surpassing \[all other\] humans,[^14]  
we were born in kṣatriyan clan\[s\]. (5) \[1108\]

\[Always\] together when \[we’re\] born,  
when karma is done, and by caste,[^15]  
born together in this last \[birth,\]  
\[we’re\] kṣatriyans,[^16] born in the clans. (6) \[1109\]

In the harem, O Great Hero,  
as though in the gods’ \[garden\] “Joy,”  
\[we’re\] beautiful, very wealthy,  
receiving honor \[and\] worship.[^17] (7) \[1110\]

Becoming wearied we went forth,  
from the home into homelessness.  
Remaining attached a few days,  
we all attained \[our\] nirvana. (8) \[1111\]

\[People\] are bringing many \[gifts,\]  
monastic robes and alms to eat,  
requisites \[as well as\] lodgings;  
we’re always honored \[and\] worshipped.[^18] (9) \[1112\]

Our defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
we are living without constraint. (10) \[1113\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for us.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[we have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[1114\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[we have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[1115\]

Thus indeed Eighteen Thousand Kṣatriyan Maiden Buddhist Nuns  
Headed Up by Famous (Yasavatī) spoke these verses.
