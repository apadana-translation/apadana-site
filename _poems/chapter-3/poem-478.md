*\[475. {478.}*[^1] *Vallikāraphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
The Sambuddha named Sumana  
lived in Takkarā[^3] at that time.  
Taking \[some\] *vallikāra*[^4] fruit,  
I gave \[it\] to the Self-Become. (1) \[5001\]  
In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that fruit at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (2) \[5002\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[5003\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[5004\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5005\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Vallikāraphaladāyaka[^5] Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Vallikāraphaladāyaka[^6] Thera is finished.
