*\[285. Maghavapupphiya*[^1]*\]*

The Self-Become, Unconquered One,

he Endowed with Meditation,

the Bright One, the Unsullied One

\[dwelt\] on River Narmada’s bank. (1) \[2642\]

With a happy heart, having seen

the Sambuddha, Unconquered One,

then with a *maghava* flower

I worshipped[^2] that Self-Become One. (2) \[2643\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2644\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2645\]

Thus indeed Venerable Maghavapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Maghavapupphiya Thera is finished.
