### \[516. {519.}[^1] Sabbaphaladāyaka[^2]\]

\[My\] name \[back then\] was Varuṇa,  
a brahmin master of mantras.  
After throwing away[^3] ten sons,[^4]  
I plunged into the forest then. (1) \[5505\]

Making a well-built hermitage,  
well-proportioned \[and\] beautiful,  
constructing a hall of leaves \[there\],  
I am living in the forest. (2) \[5506\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
with a desire to lift me up,  
\[then\] came up to my hermitage. (3) \[5507\]

Throughout that forest grove, there was  
a huge effulgence \[of his light\].  
By the Buddha’s special powers[^5]  
he lit up the forest back then. (4) \[5508\]

After seeing that[^6] miracle  
of the Best Buddha, Neutral One,  
taking a satchel made of leaves,[^7]  
I filled \[it\] with fruit at that time. (5) \[5509\]

Having gone up to the Buddha,  
I gave \[him the fruit\] with the bag.[^8]  
The Buddha, with pity for me,  
spoke these words \[to me at that time\]: (6) \[5510\]

“After bringing a *khārī*-load,[^9]  
you, come along behind me \[now\],  
and when the Assembly eats[^10] it,  
there will be good karma[^11] for you. (7) \[5511\]

Taking that satchel \[of leaves\],[^12] I  
gave \[it\] to the monks’ Assembly.  
After having pleased \[my\] heart there,  
I was reborn in Tusitā. (8) \[5512\]

There, bound up with \[my\] good[^13] karma,  
I am enjoying, all the time,  
dances and songs \[performed for me\],  
also speeches which are divine. (9) \[5513\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
I have no lack of possessions:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (10) \[5514\]

Having given the Buddha fruit,[^14]  
I am exercising lordship  
through the four great continents,  
including oceans and mountains. (11) \[5515\]

As far as they, the flocks of birds,  
are flying across the sky, they  
too obey[^15] my authority:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (12) \[5516\]

\[All\] the spirits,[^16] ghosts,[^17] and demons,  
the *kumbhaṇḍa*\s and *garuḷa*\s,  
throughout \[that\] grove in the forest,  
approach \[in order to\] serve me. (13) \[5517\]

Turtles \[and\] dogs[^18] \[and\] honey-bees,  
both gadflies[^19] and mosquitos;[^20] they  
too obey[^21] my authority:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (14) \[5518\]

The birds that are called Suparṇas[^22]  
born to birds \[but\] having great strength,  
they too go to me for refuge:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (15) \[5519\]

Cobra-gods who have long lives,  
superpowers, \[also\] great fame; they  
too obey my authority:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (16) \[5520\]

Lions and tigers and leopards,  
bears,[^23] wolves,[^24] *kara bānā* bears;[^25] they  
too obey my authority:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (17) \[5521\]

Those who live in herbs[^26] and in grass,[^27]  
also those who live in the sky;  
they all go to me for refuge:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (18) \[5522\]

Hard to see[^28] \[and\] very subtle,  
deep, very well explicated;  
having seen \[that Teaching\] I dwell:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (19) \[5523\]

The eight deliverances seen,  
I am \[now\] dwelling, undefiled;  
energetic, intelligent:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (20) \[5524\]

Those Buddha’s sons, with the eight fruits,  
free of flaws \[and\] very famous,  
I am \[now also\] one of them:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (21) \[5525\]

Mastering special knowledges,  
incited by \[my\] wholesome roots,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled. (22) \[5526\]

Three knowledges, powers[^29] attained,  
are Buddha’s sons, the greatly famed,  
who are endowed with “divine ear”:  
I am \[now also\] one of them. (23) \[5527\]

In the hundred thousand aeons,  
since I gave \[him\] that fruit back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (24) \[5528\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (25) \[5529\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (26) \[5530\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (27) \[5531\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sabbaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sabbaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.
