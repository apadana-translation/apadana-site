*\[472. {475.}*[^1] *Kummāsadāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
When Vipassi, the Sage So Great,  
was going about as \[he\] wished,  
seeing \[that his\] bowl was empty,  
I filled \[it\] with barley porridge.[^3] (1) \[4986\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave that alms food at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of barley porridge. (2) \[4987\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4988\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4989\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4990\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Kummāsadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kummāsadāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Barley-Porridge Donor.” This same *apadāna* is repeated below as
    \#{559}, verbatim. There it is ascribed to the historical monk
    Sīvaka.  
[^3]: *kummāsa,* Skt. *kulmāṣa*, a preparation of barley, either as a
    soft porridge or jgruel (PSI *yavayen kaḷ aharayak,”*a food made
    with barley;” BJTS Sinh. gloss *komupiṇḍu,* “soft-boiled alms”), or
    as an unleavened cake or junket (PSI: Sinh. *roṭiya*). Given the
    description of “filling” the empty bowl, the former seems more
    likely and I have translated accordingly. It is at any rate some
    food made out of barley.
