*\[335. {338.}*[^1] *Uttareyyadāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
In the city, Haṃsavatī,  
I was a brahmin at that time,  
a scholar \[who\] knew the mantras,  
a master of the three Vedas. (1) \[3021\]

I was honored by \[my\] students,  
of good birth, well-educated,  
I went out from the city then  
for a water-consecration.[^3] (2) \[3022\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
was the Master of Everything.[^4]  
The Victor entered the city  
with one thousand undefiled ones.[^5] (3) \[3023\]

Seeing \[him\] surrounded by saints,[^6]  
I brought \[great\] pleasure to my heart,  
as though made free of lust by \[just\]  
seeing \[him\], the Good-Looking One.[^7] (4) \[3024\]

Hands pressed together on \[my\] head  
I worshipped[^8] the Compliant One.[^9]  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I donated an upper cloak.[^10] (5) \[3025\]

Taking it with both of my hands,  
I threw \[that\] cloak \[into the sky\].  
\[That\] cloak became a canopy[^11]  
as big as Buddha’s retinue. (6) \[3026\]

It remained \[there\] covering \[that\]  
massive group of monks and others  
going about in search of alms;[^12]  
then \[that miracle\] made me smile. (7) \[3027\]

When \[he\] departed from the house,[^13]  
the Self-Become One, Chief Person,  
the Teacher, standing in the road,[^14]  
gave me this expression of thanks:[^15] (8) \[3028\]

“I shall relate details of him  
who, happy, heart \[filled with\] pleasure,  
made a gift of this cloak to me;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (9) \[3029\]

For thirty thousand aeons he  
will delight in the world of gods.  
Fifty times the lord of the gods,  
he will exercise divine rule. (10) \[3030\]

While he, endowed with good karma,[^16]  
is dwelling in the world of gods,  
there will be a cloth canopy  
a hundred leagues on every side. (11) \[3031\]

And thirty-six times he will be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\],  
\[and he will have\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (12) \[3032\]

While he, endowed with good karma,[^17]  
is transmigrating in the world,[^18]  
everything wished for with \[his\] mind  
will be realized,[^19] all the time. (13) \[3033\]

This man is going to receive  
cloth which is very expensive:  
silk cloth[^20] and woolen blankets[^21] too,  
*khoma* and also cotton cloth.[^22] (14) \[3034\]

Everything wished for with \[his\] mind,  
this man is going to receive.  
He’s always going to enjoy  
the result of one piece of cloth. (15) \[3035\]

And afterwards, having gone forth,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
he will realize for himself  
the Blessed Gotama’s Teaching.[^23] (16) \[3036\]

O! That karma well done by me  
for the Omniscient One, Great Sage!  
Having given a single cloak,  
I have attained the deathless state. (17) \[3037\]

When I am in a pavilion,[^24]  
a tree-root or an empty house,  
a cloth canopy is carried  
for me, a fathom on each side. (18) \[3038\]

And because of \[that\] robe \[I gave,\]  
I’m dressed \[in clothes\] without asking.[^25]  
I receive[^26] food \[and also\] drink:  
that’s the fruit of an upper cloak. (19) \[3039\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I did that \[good\] karma then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving cloth. (20) \[3040\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (21) \[3041\]

Thus indeed Venerable Uttareyyadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Uttareyyadāyaka Thera is finished.
