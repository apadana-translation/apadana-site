*\[47. Sayanadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
I gave an excellent bedstead  
covered with \[all of the\] bedclothes[^2]  
to Siddhattha, the Blessed One,  
Loving-Hearted, the Neutral One. (1) \[1202\]  
\[Then\] the Blessed One accepted  
\[that\] appropriate bed-and-chair.  
\[And\] having risen from that seat  
the Victor flew up in the air. (2) \[1203\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that bed \[way back then,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that is the fruit of a bedstead. (3) \[1204\]  
The one called Varuṇa Deva,[^3]  
possessor of the seven gems,  
was a wheel-turner with great strength  
in the fifty-first aeon \[hence\]. (4) \[1205\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1206\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Sayanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sayanadāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Bed-Giver”  
[^2]: lit., “covered with things \[made of\] cloth”  
[^3]: “King Varuṇa” or “\[King\] Varuṇa God”
