### \[264. Araṇadīpiya[^1]\]

I, being reborn as a god,  
coming down to the earth back then,  
made a donation of five lamps,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands. (1) \[2553\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I donated that lamp back then,  
I’ve come to no know bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of lamp-donations. (2) \[2554\]

In the fifty-fifth aeon \[hence\]  
there lived one ruler of the earth,  
\[who was\] named Samantacakkhu,[^2]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (3) \[2555\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2556\]

Thus indeed Venerable Araṇadīpiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Araṇadīpiya Thera is finished.
