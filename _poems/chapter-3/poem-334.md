### {\*334, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> only: Ekadussadāyaka[^1]}

In the city, Haṃsavatī,  
I was a grass-bearer \[back then\].  
I am living by bearing grass,  
and by that I feed \[my\] children. \[2949\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
was the Master of Everything.[^2]  
Doing away with the darkness,  
the World-Leader arose back then. \[2950\]

\[While\] sitting down in \[my\] own house,  
this is what I thought at that time:  
“The Buddha’s risen in the world,  
\[but\] I lack anything to give.  
I \[only\] have this single cloak,  
I do not have \[my own\] donor.  
Suffering is a taste of hell;[^3]  
I will \[now\] plant a donation.” \[2951-2952\]

Contemplating \[it\] in this way,  
I brought pleasure to \[my\] own heart.  
Taking that single piece of cloth,  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha. \[2953\]

Having given \[that\] single cloth,  
I gave rise to \[great\] shouts of joy,  
“If you are a Buddha, Wise One,  
carry me across, O Great Sage.” \[2954\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
singing the praises of my gift,  
\[the Buddha\] then gave thanks to me: \[2955\]

“Because of this single cloak\[-gift,\]  
\[done\] with intention and resolve,  
he will not go to a bad place  
for one hundred thousand[^4] aeons. \[2956\]

Thirty-six times a lord of gods,  
he will exercise divine rule.  
And thirty-three times he’ll become  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. \[2957\]

There will be much regional rule,  
incalculable by counting.  
In the world of gods or of men,  
you’ll transmigrate in existence. \[2958\]

Good-looking and full of virtue,  
with a body that’s not surpassed,  
you’ll obtain, whenever you wish,  
unwavering limitless cloth.” \[2959\]

When he had said this, the Buddha  
known by the name Supreme Lotus,[^5]  
the Wise One rose into the sky,  
just like a swan-king in the air. \[2960\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
I have no lack of possessions:  
that’s the fruit of a single cloth. \[2961\]

With every footstep \[that I take\],[^6]  
\[some\] cloth is \[then\] produced for me.  
I stand upon cloth underneath;  
a canopy on top of me. \[2962\]

\[And\] today I \[still\] am wishing  
that I could cover with \[some\] cloth  
even the \[whole\] universe  
with \[its\] forests \[and its\] mountains. \[2963\]

Just because of that single cloth,  
transmigrating from birth to birth,  
I was[^7] one of golden color,  
transmigrating from birth to birth.[^8] \[2964\]

\[One\] result of that single cloth:  
no ruination anywhere.[^9]  
This one \[will be my\] final life;  
\[that\] now is bearing fruit for me. \[2965\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave that cloth at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a single cloth. \[2966\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. \[2967\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[2968\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekadussadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekadussadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “One-Cloth-Donor”

[^2]: lit., “Master of All Things (*dhamma*)” (or “Master of All Teachings”). This *apadāna* is included verbatim as \#419 {422} below, ascribed to a monk of the same name. Presumably following the colophonic demand for an “Ekadussika” at this point in the text, editors in the mss. tradition on which <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> is based supplied this *apadāna* verbatim from a different part of the text, in order to fill the gap.

[^3]: *niraya-samphassa*, lit., “contact with hell” “touching of hell” “experience of hell”

[^4]: amending *kappasatahassāni* to *kappasattasahassāni*, which keeps the meter and makes sense

[^5]: *jalajuttamanāmaka*

[^6]: lit., “footstep after footstep,” or more literally still, “on footstep on footstep,” reduplicated to suggest the whole series. This interpretation follows the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss.

[^7]: lit., "having been”

[^8]: the repetition of the second foot as the fourth foot does not seem to be intentional, as it carries no poetic force and leaves the verse in need of a finite verb (which I have supplied in my reading of the gerund, see previous note). But if this is an unintended mistake, it was made long ago, as all the mss. apparently witness it.

[^9]: lit., “not going up into destruction anywhere”
