*\[220. Pāpanivāriya*[^1]*\]*  
The Blessed One, Piyadassi’s  
walkway was purified by me,  
with a covering made of reeds[^2]  
to block the wind and heat \[for him\]. (1) \[2369\]

For the sake of punishing sin,[^3]  
there is achievement of goodness.[^4]  
To destroy defilements[^5] I  
worked hard in the dispensation.[^6] (2) \[2370\]

In the eleventh aeon hence  
\[lived one\] known as Aggideva,[^7]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2371\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2372\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pāpanivāriya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pāpanivāriya Thera is finished.
