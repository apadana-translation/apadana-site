### \[411. {414.}[^1] Madhumaŋsadāyaka[^2]\]

In the city, Bandhumatī,  
I was a pork-seller[^3] \[back then\].  
Having cooked the spleen and lungs,[^4]  
I poured honey over \[that\] meat.[^5] (1) \[4373\]

Having gone to a gathering,[^6]  
I took hold of a single bowl.  
Filling up that bowl \[with meat\], I  
gave it to the monks’ Assembly. (2) \[4374\]

The monk there who was most senior  
then assigned[^7] \[the merit\] to me:  
“due to filling this bowl \[with meat\],  
he will receive great happiness. (3) \[4375\]

Receiving[^8] the two attainments,[^9]  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
during \[his\] last going around,  
he will destroy the defilements.” (4) \[4376\]

Bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart there,  
I \[then\] went to Tāvatiṃsa.  
Eating as well as drinking there,  
I do receive great happiness. (5) \[4377\]

In a pavilion or tree-root,  
recalling previous karma,  
a downpour of \[both\] food and drink  
is raining on me all the time. (6) \[4378\]

This is the final time for me;  
\[my\] last rebirth is proceeding.[^10]  
Even here \[both\] food and drink are[^11]  
raining on me all of the time. (7) \[4379\]

Because of having given meat,  
transmigrating in existence,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
I am living without constraint.[^12] (8) \[4380\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave that offering back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving meat. (9) \[4381\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (10) \[4382\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[4383\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[4384\]

Thus indeed Venerable Madhumaŋsadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Madhumaŋsadāyaka Thera is finished.
