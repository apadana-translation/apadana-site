*\[90. Padumapupphiya*[^1]*\]*

I lived in a lotus forest

eating lotus flowers \[back then\].

I saw Phussa, the Sambuddha,

Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks.[^2] (1) \[1547\]

Picking up a lotus flower

I tossed it up into the air.

Having done this pleasing karma

I went forth into homelessness. (2) \[1548\]

Having renounced, with self-control

over my body and \[my\] mind,

and refraining from bad speech-acts

I purified my livelihood. (3) \[1549\]

In the ninety-two aeons since

I offered that flower \[to him\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (4) \[1550\]

There were eighteen lords of the earth

\[all\] known as Padumābhāsa,[^3]

and in the eighteenth aeon \[hence\]

there were forty-eight \[such monarchs\]. (5) \[1551\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1552\]

Thus indeed Venerable Padumapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Padumapupphiya Thera is finished.
