*\[116. Citakapūjaka*[^1]*\]*  
When Sikhi the Blessed One, the  
Kinsman of the World, passed away,[^2]  
I \[then\] lived in the royal sphere,  
with the ministers and servants. (1) \[1725\]  
Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I went to the shrine \[built for him\].  
Having *turiya-*drums played there  
I laid a garland of flowers. (2) \[1726\]  
Having done *pūjā* at that shrine  
and worshipping the shrine \[itself\],  
happy, \[and\] with a happy heart  
I \[then\] returned to \[my\] own house. (3) \[1727\]  
Having entered \[my\] residence,  
I called to mind that shrine-*pūjā.*  
Through that deed for the Biped-Lord,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men, (4) \[1728\]  
having enjoyed \[great\] happiness  
among humans and also gods,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state  
beyond \[all\] conquest and defeat. (5) \[1729\]  
In the thirty-one aeons since  
I offered that flower \[to him,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of shrine-*pūjā.* (6) \[1730\]  
In the twenty-ninth aeon thence  
there were sixteen \[different\] kings \[then,\]  
\[all\] known by the name Uggata,[^3]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (7) \[1731\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[1732\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Citakapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Citakapūjaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Shrine-Worshipper”  
[^2]: lit., “reached nirvana”  
[^3]: “Risen Up”.
