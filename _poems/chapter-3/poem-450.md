### \[447. {450.}[^1] Bodhighariya[^2]\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I had a Bodhi-tree shrine[^3] made  
for Siddhattha, the Blessed One,  
the Biped-Lord, the Neutral One. (1) \[4785\]

Being reborn in Tusitā,[^4]  
I live in a house \[made of\] gems.  
There’s neither cold nor hot for me;  
the wind does not touch my body. (2) \[4786\]

In the fifty-sixth aeon hence  
I was a wheel-turning monarch;  
my city known as Kāsika,[^5]  
constructed by Vissakamma,[^6]  
was spread out for ten leagues \[in length,\]  
\[and it measured\] eight leagues in width.  
No\[thing\] in that city was \[made  
of\][^7] sticks \[or of\] vines \[or of\] clay. (3-4) \[4787-4788\]

\[My\] palace known as Maṅgala,[^8]  
constructed by Vissakamma,  
\[measured\] a league across \[in length,\]  
and it was a half a league wide. (5) \[4789\]

\[Its\] eighty-four thousand pillars  
were \[all made out of solid\] gold;  
the pinnacles were made of gems,  
and the roofs were \[made of\] silver. (6) \[4790\]

That house all made of \[solid\] gold,  
constructed by Vissakamma,  
was occupied by me \[back then\]:  
that’s the fruit of giving a shrine.[^9] (7) \[4791\]

After enjoying all of that,  
in the world[^10] of gods \[and of\] men,  
today I have reached nirvana,  
the peaceful state that’s unexcelled. (8) \[4792\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I had that Bodhi\[-tree-\]shrine made,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving a shrine. (9) \[4793\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (10) \[4794\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[4795\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[4796\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bodhighariya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bodhighariya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Bodhi Tree Shrine-er”

[^3]: *bodhigharam*, lit., “bodhi \[tree\] house,” an enclosure surrounding a Bodhi tree which functions both as shrine and as protection for the tree. Siddhattha Buddha’s Bodhi tree was a *kaṇikāra*, “dinner-plate tree”

[^4]: the heaven of happiness

[^5]: “in the Benares Country”,” cf. Kāsi, Benares, where many of the *Jātaka* stories are set.

[^6]: Vishwakarma, “the divine architect”

[^7]: I follow <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss in interpolating “thing” as the subject of the half-verse, which otherwise would mean that sticks, vines and clay were themselves absent from (*n’atthi*, “do not exist”) in that city.

[^8]: “Auspicious” “Festival”

[^9]: lit., “of giving a \[Bodhi tree\] house”

[^10]: or “state” “existence”: *bhave* rather than *loke*

[^11]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> *Viṭabhīkī* is an obvious typographical error here

[^12]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads Uttal’
