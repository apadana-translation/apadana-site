*\[421. {424.}*[^1] *Sattakadambapupphiya*[^2]*\]*

In the Himalayan region,

there’s a mountain named Kadamba.[^3]

There were seven Buddhas living

\[there\] on the side of the mountain. (1) \[4522\]

Seeing a kadam[^4] \[tree\] in bloom,

pressing both my hands together,

taking seven of \[its\] flowers,

I placed them, thinking of merit.[^5] (2) \[4523\]

Due to that karma done very well,

with intention and \[firm\] resolve,

discarding \[my\] human body,

I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (3) \[4524\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I did that \[good\] karma back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[4525\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (5) \[4526\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4527\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4528\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sattakadambapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sattakadambapupphiya Thera is finished.
