*Ummāpupphiya Chapter, the Thirty-Third*

*\[321. Ummāpupphiya*[^1]*\]*

I saw the Ultimate Person,

Siddhattha, the Unconquered One,

Attentive One, He Who Attained,

sitting down[^2] in meditation. (1) \[2825\]

Having gathered \[blue\] flax[^3] flowers,

I offered \[them\] to the Buddha.

All the flowers faced the same way,

stems turned upward, heads turned downward. (2) \[2826\]

Like pretty pictures they remained,

floral canopy in the sky.

Because of that mental pleasure,

I was reborn in Tusitā. (3) \[2827\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[2828\]

In the fifty-fifth aeon hence

there was one \[man\], lord of the earth,

known as Samantacchadana,[^4]

a wheel-turning king with great strength. (5) \[2829\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2830\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ummāpupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ummāpupphiya Thera is finished.

[^3]: *ummāpuppha* (Skt. *umāpuṣpa*), Linum usitatissimum, Linseed. The
    small flowers of this fiber-bearing plant are distinctively and
    deeply blue in color, and the seeds, as the English name implies,
    bear a useful oil.
