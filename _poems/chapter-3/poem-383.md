*\[380. {383.}*[^1] *Udumbaraphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*

The Ultimate Person dwelt on

the banks of Vinatā River.

I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,

the Calm One,[^3] Very Composed One.[^4] (1) \[3292\]

\[My\] mind \[full of\] pleasure in him,

who Cleans the Stain of Defilement,[^5]

gathering *udumbara*[^6] fruit

I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha. (2) \[3293\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I gave \[the Buddha\] fruit \[back then\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[3294\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3295\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (5) \[3296\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[3297\]

Thus indeed Venerable Udumbaraphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Udumbaraphaladāyaka Thera is finished.
