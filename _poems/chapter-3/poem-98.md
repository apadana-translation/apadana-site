### \[98. Senāsanadāyaka[^1]\]

I gave a mat made out of leaves  
to Siddhattha, the Blessed One,  
and served \[that Buddha\] thoroughly,  
\[then\] scattered flowers \[around for him\]. (1) \[1595\]

I enjoyed a very costly  
pleasant cave, and palaces \[too\];  
flowers which were most expensive  
dropped into my bed at that time. (2) \[1596\]

On my bed I snuggled on an  
ornamented mat of flowers,  
and a rain of flowers always  
rained down upon my bed \[back then\]. (3) \[1597\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave that mat made out of leaves,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a giving a mat. (4) \[1598\]

There were seven wheel-turning kings  
\[all\] named Ṭhitosanthāraka[^2]  
who were born, those lords of people,  
\[then\] in the fifth aeon \[ago\]. (5) \[1599\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1600\]

Thus indeed Venerable Senāsanadāyaka[^3] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Senāsanadāyaka Thera is finished.
