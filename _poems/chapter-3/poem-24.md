# \[24. Pañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>asīlasamādāniya[^1]\]

In the city, <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andavatī,[^2]  
I was a servant-man back then.  
Bound in the service of others  
I could not renounce the world \[yet\]: (1) \[948\]

“Being shrouded in great blindness  
I’m being scorched by the three fires.[^3]  
By what strategy might I then  
be set free \[from this samsara\]? (2) \[949\]

I lack the things to be given;  
I am a miserable servant.  
Why then don’t I guard and fulfill  
the five \[basic\] moral precepts? (3) \[950\]

Nisabha is a follower  
of the Sage, Anomadassi.  
Having approached him I’ll adopt  
the five moral training precepts.” (4) \[951\]

In those days the normal lifespan  
was \[full\] one hundred thousand years.  
For all that time I did protect  
the five moral precepts fully. (5) \[952\]

When the time for \[my\] death arrived  
the gods \[all then\] consoled me \[thus\]:  
“Happy one, \[you will\] be served \[by\]  
this one-thousand-horse chariot.” (6) \[953\]

In my heart, as I breathed my last,[^4]  
I recalled those \[five\] moral rules.  
Through that karma which was done well  
I went on to Tāvatiṃsa. (7) \[954\]

Thirty times as the king of gods  
I exercised divine rule \[there\].  
Anointed by celestial nymphs  
I enjoyed \[much\] divine pleasure. (8) \[955\]

\[Fully\] five hundred times I ruled  
as a monarch who turns the wheel,  
\[and I did have\] much local rule  
innumerable by counting. (9) \[956\]

Falling down from the world of gods,  
incited by \[my\] wholesome roots,  
I was born in a rich family  
with a big house in Vesāli.[^5] (10) \[957\]

When the rainy season started,  
the Victor’s dispensation shined.  
My mother and my father too  
took on the five moral precepts. (11) \[958\]

And I, hearing \[that word\] “moral”  
recalled my \[past\] morality.  
I sat down on a single seat  
\[and\] attained \[my\] arahantship. (12) \[959\]

Though I was \[only\] five years old  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.  
Knowing virtue the Eyeful One,  
the Buddha \[then\] ordained \[me there\]. (13) \[960\]

Having perfectly protected  
those five \[basic\] moral precepts,  
for aeons beyond measure I  
went to no place of suffering. (14) \[961\]

That I experienced \[great\] fame  
due to those \[five\] moral precepts.  
Talking for ten million aeons  
I still could tell but part of it.[^6] (15) \[962\]

Guarding the five moral precepts  
I received the three \[good\] results:[^7]  
I had long life, abundant food  
and developed piercing wisdom. (16) \[963\]

\[My\] outstanding human action  
is \[now\] proclaimed to everyone.  
Transmigrating from birth to birth  
I obtain those \[three good results\].[^8] (17) \[964\]

If a pupil of the Victor  
should \[thus\] delight throughout his lives  
in the limitless moral rules,  
what might \[his\] result \[then\] be like? (18) \[965\]

The five precepts[^9] were practiced well  
by me, a wise servant-man \[then\].  
Due to that moral discipline  
today I’m freed[^10] from every bond. (19) \[966\]

I guarded the five moral rules  
uncountable aeons ago.  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of the five precepts.[^11] (20) \[967\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (21) \[968\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>asīlasamādāniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>asīlasamādāniya Thera is finished.
