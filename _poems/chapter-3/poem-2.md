### \[2. Mahā-Moggallāna\]

Anomadassi, Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
was living in the Himalayas,  
Honored by the Gods’ Assembly. (1) \[374\]

I was then a king of snake-gods,[^1]  
known by the name of Varuṇa.[^2]  
Taking on the form of Cupid[^3]  
I was dwelling in the ocean. (2) \[375\]

Being in a musical group,  
I provided the percussion.[^4]  
After serving the Sambuddha,  
the divine nymphs[^5] then sang \[their songs\]. (3) \[376\]

When the drums were being beaten  
the gods then also beat on drums.  
Upon hearing the sound of both,  
the Buddha himself then listened. (4) \[377\]

Having invited Sambuddha  
that he come over to my house,  
providing an appointed seat.  
I announced that it was \[now\] time. (5) \[378\]

With one thousand flawless arahants[^6]  
following behind, that World-Chief,[^7]  
shining light in all directions  
did come over to my house \[then\]. (6) \[379\]

I satisfied with food and drink  
the Great Hero who had arrived,  
the God of Gods, the Bull of Men  
along with the monks’ Assembly. (7) \[380\]

The Great Hero was delighted,  
the Self-Existent, Top Human;  
seated in the monks’ Assembly  
he spoke these verses \[about me\]: (8) \[381\]

“He who worshipped the assembly  
and also the Buddha, World-Chief,[^8]  
due to the pleasure in \[his\] heart,  
will go into the world of gods. (9) \[382\]

He will exercise divine rule  
seventy-seven \[different\] times.  
He will reside upon the earth,  
\[and\] have eight hundred earthly reigns. (10) \[383\]

And he’ll be a wheel-turning king  
five and fifty \[different\] times.  
All the time they will bring for him  
uncountable \[amounts of\] wealth. (11) \[384\]

Aeons beyond measure from now,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (12) \[385\]

After having come out of hell  
he will go to a human state.  
Known by the name of Kolita  
he’ll be a kinsman of Brahma.[^9] (13) \[386\]

He’ll afterwards go forth, renouncing,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots.  
He’ll be second chief-follower  
of the Blessed One, Gotama. (14) \[387\]

Resolved,[^10] with strenuous effort,[^11]  
he’ll excel in superpowers.  
Knowing well all the defilements  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (15) \[388\]

Depending on \[some\] evil friends,  
overpowered by lust \[and\] anger,  
being cruel-minded I slew  
my mother and my father too. (16) \[389\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn  
in hell or \[else\] among humans  
since[^12] I possess that bad karma  
I get murdered,[^13] head split open. (17) \[390\]

This is the final time for me;  
\[my\] last rebirth is proceeding.[^14]  
And also here, like that, for me  
a time for getting killed will be. (18) \[391\]

Binding \[myself\] to solitude,  
fond of *samādhi*-meditation,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled. (19) \[392\]

Excelling in superpowers  
I shake with only my left thumb  
this very earth which is so deep,  
thick and difficult to destroy. (20) \[393\]

I don’t feel the pride of “I am;”  
no pride at all exists in me.  
Even regarding novices  
I act with reverence in \[my\] heart. (21) \[394\]

I brought forward the karma done  
in an aeon so long ago.[^15]  
That I has now attained the earth;[^16]  
I’ve reached the end of defilements. (22) \[395\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. \[396\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[397\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (23) \[398\]

Thus indeed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Mahāmoggallāna Thera is finished.
