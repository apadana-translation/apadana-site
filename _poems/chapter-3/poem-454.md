*\[451. {454.}*[^1] *Tiṇukkadhāriya*[^2]*\]*  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I carried three \[grass\] torches at  
the foot of the superb Bodhi[^3]  
of Padumuttara Buddha. (1) \[4818\]  
In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I carried those torches \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving torches. (2) \[4819\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4820\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4821\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4822\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Tiṇukkadhāriya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Tiṇukkadhāriya Thera is finished.

    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Grass-Torch-Bearer,” BJTS reads less ambiguously
    *Tiṇukkādhārakaº*  
[^3]: i.e., at the base of his Bodhi tree, which was a *salala* tree.
