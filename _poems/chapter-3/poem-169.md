### \[169. Samādapaka[^1]\]

In the city, Bandhumatī,  
there was a large multitude[^2] \[then\].  
I was most excellent of them,  
and they were \[all\] my companions.[^3] (1) \[2093\]

Having called them all together  
I \[then\] promoted good karma,[^4]  
“let’s build the unsurpassed merit-field,  
the \[monks’\] Assembly, a building.”[^5] (2) \[2094\]

Those followers of my wishes[^6]  
agreed \[by saying\], “Excellent!”  
and \[when\] they finished the building,  
we gave[^7] it to Vipassi \[then\]. (3) \[2095\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that building back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving buildings. (4) \[2096\]

In the fifty-ninth aeon \[hence\]  
there was one lord of the people,  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
known by the name of Āveyya.[^8] (5) \[2097\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2098\]

Thus indeed Venerable Samādapaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Samādapaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Instructor”

[^2]: see note to v. \[1601\]; this is the same term, *mahāpūgagaṇa*.

[^3]: this follows <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *baddha<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>arā*, “connected farers.” <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reads paddha<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>arā, One would prefer *sadā<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>arā*, or perhaps *saddha<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>arā* (“fellow faithful”).

[^4]: lit., “I caused them to undertake meritorious action.”

[^5]: lit., “a large, one-peaked building (*māḷa*)”. Cf note to 1915.

[^6]: lit., “they who followed under the power of my wishes/iintentions”

[^7]: *adamhase*, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> glosses *api vipassi budurajunhaṭ eya dunumha*

[^8]: “Seen”? <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads Ādeyya, “That which should be taken,” which is not much more satisfactory.
