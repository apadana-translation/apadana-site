*\[169. Samādapaka*[^1]*\]*

In the city, Bandhumatī,

there was a large multitude[^2] \[then\].

I was most excellent of them,

and they were \[all\] my companions.[^3] (1) \[2093\]

Having called them all together

I \[then\] promoted good karma,[^4]

“let’s build the unsurpassed merit-field,

the \[monks’\] Assembly, a building.”[^5] (2) \[2094\]

Those followers of my wishes[^6]

agreed \[by saying\], “Excellent!”

and \[when\] they finished the building,

we gave[^7] it to Vipassi \[then\]. (3) \[2095\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I gave \[him\] that building back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of giving buildings. (4) \[2096\]

In the fifty-ninth aeon \[hence\]

there was one lord of the people,

a wheel-turning king with great strength,

known by the name of Āveyya.[^8] (5) \[2097\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2098\]

Thus indeed Venerable Samādapaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Samādapaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Instructor”

[^2]: see note to v. \[1601\]; this is the same term, *mahāpūgagaṇa.*

[^3]: this follows BJTS Sinhala gloss. BJTS reads *baddhacarā,*
    “connected farers.” PTS reads paddhacarā, One would prefer
    *sadācarā,* or perhaps *saddhacarā* (“fellow faithful”).

[^4]: lit., “I caused them to undertake meritorious action.”

[^5]: lit., “a large, one-peaked building (*māḷa*)”. Cf note to 1915.

[^6]: lit., “they who followed under the power of my wishes/iintentions”

[^7]: *adamhase,* BJTS glosses *api vipassi budurajunhaṭ eya dunumha*

[^8]: “Seen”? BJTS reads Ādeyya, “That which should be taken,” which is
    not much more satisfactory.
