### \[403. {406.}[^1] Nanda[^2]\]

I was a deer-hunter back then,  
within a grove in the forest.  
\[While\] searching after[^3] spotted deer,  
I saw the Self-Become One \[there\]. (1) \[4050\]

The Sambuddha named Anuraddha,[^4]  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
Seclusion-Lover, the Wise One,[^5]  
plunged into the forest[^6] back then. (2) \[4051\]

Having gathered four sticks of wood,  
I placed them in four \[corner-\]spots.  
Building a well-built pavilion,  
I covered \[it\] with lotus blooms.[^7] (3) \[4052\]

Having covered the pavilion,  
I greeted the Self-Become One.  
Laying aside my bow right there,  
I went forth into homelessness. (4) \[4053\]

A short time after going forth,  
I was afflicted with illness.[^8]  
Transmigrating through past karma,  
I passed away \[right then and\] there. (5) \[4054\]

Bound up with \[my\] former karma,  
I went to Tusitā heaven.  
There a mansion made out of gold[^9]  
is produced according to wish. (6) \[4055\]

\[My\] divine carriage stands in wait,  
a thousand-horse-yoked vehicle.  
Ascending into that carriage,  
I travel according to wish. (7) \[4056\]

When I am going out[^10] from there,  
having been reborn as a god,[^11]  
a pavilion’s held up for me  
a hundred leagues on every side. (8) \[4057\]

I \[always\] nestle[^12] on a bed  
that’s constantly strewn with flowers.  
And from the sky, pink lotuses  
are raining \[on me\] all the time. (9) \[4058\]

When the rays of light are throbbing,  
and the sun’s heat scorches \[the world\],  
the heat is not oppressing me:  
that’s the fruit of a pavilion. (10) \[4059\]

I pass beyond \[all\] bad rebirth;  
the states of woe[^13] are closed to me.  
In a pavilion or tree-root,  
burning heat is not known by me. (11) \[4060\]

Fixing perception on the earth,[^14]  
I cross over the \[great\] ocean.[^15]  
That’s my well-done karma, the fruit  
of \[doing\] that Buddha-*pūjā*. (12) \[4061\]

Making roads, even with no road,  
I am traveling[^16] in the sky.  
O! that karma well-done by me:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (13) \[4062\]

I know former existences,  
the “divine eye” is purified,  
my defilements are \[all\] destroyed:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (14) \[4063\]

Buddha’s legitimate offspring,  
worthy heir to the Great Teaching,  
I’ve renounced my earlier birth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (15) \[4064\]

I’m one who pleased the Well-Gone-One,  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,  
the *Dhamma*’s heir, I bear its flag:[^17]  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (16) \[4065\]

After serving the Sambuddha,  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,  
I asked the Leader of the World  
\[about\] the path that goes beyond.[^18] (17) \[4066\]

Being asked, the Buddha \[then\] told  
the deep and subtle state \[beyond\].  
Having heard that Teaching of his,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.[^19] (18) \[4067\]

O! that karma well-done by me!  
I’m fully freed from being born;  
I have destroyed all defilements;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (19) \[4068\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (20) \[4069\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (21) \[4070\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (22) \[4071\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nanda Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Nanda Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Joy”. BJTS reads *Nandaka*

[^3]: PTS reads *pasadamigaŋ gavesanto*; BJTS reads *pasadaṃ migam esanto*. The two readings have virtually the same meaning; unlike the PTS reading, however, the BJTS reading keeps the meter

[^4]: PTS and BJTS agree on this reading, even though it breaks meter; following the text, this first foot contains nine syllable. One would prefer “the Buddha named Anuruddha” (*anuruddho nāma buddho*, eight syllables) to keep the meter, but as many of the other Buddhas have three-syllable names, the pattern is “*X nāma Sambuddho*” and here the manuscripts (and the authors?) have followed suit.

[^5]: reading *so dhīro* with BJTS for PTS *so vīro*, “the Hero”

[^6]: *vanamajjh’*, lit., “in the middle of the forest”

[^7]: *padumapupphehi*, lit., “with pink lotus flowers”

[^8]: *vyādhi me udapajjatha* (BJTS reads *upapajjatha*), lit “illness came into existence for me”

[^9]: BJTS reads *sovaṇṇamayaṃ* for PTS *sovaṇṇayaŋ*, thereby breaking meter.

[^10]: BJTS reads *niyamāna* for PTS *niyyamāna*, to the same end (“\[the one\] taking that carriage and going”)

[^11]: *devabhūtassa me sato*, lit., “when I am being born as a god”

[^12]: reading *tuvaṭṭāmi* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *tuvaṭṭhāmi*. The term means to share with, cuddle, snuggle up; BJTS provides the less evocative gloss “I sleep” (*nidimi*)

[^13]: *apāyā*, “hells,” reckoned as four: hell proper (*niraya*) and rebirth as an animal, a ghost (*peta*), or a titan (*asura*).

[^14]: *mahīsaññam adhiṭṭhāya*, lit., “having fixed \[my\] mind (or concentrating) on perception of the earth”

[^15]: *loṇatoyaŋ*, lit., “the salt water”. This interpretation follows BJTS

[^16]: lit., “going”

[^17]: *dhammaddhajo dhammadāyādo*, lit., “\[I am\] one who possesses the flag (or banner) of the Teaching, worthy heir of the Teaching”

[^18]: *pāraṅgamaniyaŋ maggaŋ*

[^19]: lit., “I attained the destruction of the outflows”
