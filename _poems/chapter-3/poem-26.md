### \[26. Dhūpadāyaka[^1]\]

I gave the incense for the hut  
of Siddhattha, the World’s Best One,  
the Blessed One, the Neutral One,  
with a mind that was very clear. (1) \[975\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
I am beloved of them all:  
that’s the fruit of giving incense. (2) \[976\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that incense back then  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving incense. (3) \[977\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[978\]

Thus indeed Venerable Dhūpadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Dhūpadāyaka Thera is finished.
