*Naḷamāli Chapter, the Forty-Eighth*  
*\[468. {471.}*[^1] *Naḷamāliya*[^2]*\]*  
I saw the Leader of the World,  
the Golden-Colored Sambuddha,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
flying[^3] along the forest top. (1) \[4936\]

Having taken a reed-flower,[^4]  
I am setting out all the time.  
There I saw \[him\], the Sambuddha,  
the Flood-Crosser, Undefiled One. (2) \[4937\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I offered[^5] that reed-flower to  
the Great Hero, Worthy of Gifts,[^6]  
the Pitier of the Whole World.[^7] (3) \[4938\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I presented \[him\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[4939\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[4940\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4941\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4942\]

Thus indeed Venerable Naḷamāliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Naḷamāliya Thera is finished.
