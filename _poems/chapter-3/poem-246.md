*\[246. Pattadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
After \[he’d\] superbly tamed \[me\],  
I made the gift of an alms-bowl  
to the Great Sage \[named\] Siddhattha,  
Honesty Embodied, Neutral. (1) \[2481\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I made that donation back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of a bowl-gift. (2) \[2482\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2483\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pattadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pattadāyaka Thera is finished.
