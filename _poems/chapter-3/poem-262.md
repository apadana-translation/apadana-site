*\[262. Telamakkhiya*[^1]*\]*  
When Siddhattha, the Blessed One,  
the Bull Among Men passed away,[^2]  
for all time I smeared oil upon  
the railing at his Bodhi \[tree\]. (1) \[2545\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I smeared oil \[on the railing\] then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of smearing \[oil\]. (2) \[2546\]

In the twenty-fourth aeon hence  
I’m the ruler[^3] named Succhavi,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2547\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances;  
six special knowledges mastered:  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2548\]

Thus indeed Venerable Telamakkhiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Telamakkhiya Thera is finished.
