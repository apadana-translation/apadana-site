*Kuṭajapupphiya Chapter, the Nineteenth*  
*\[181. Kuṭajapupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
\[I saw\] the golden Sambuddha,  
like the risen hundred-rayed \[sun\],  
surveying \[all\] the directions,  
while he traveled \[up\] in the sky. (1) \[2152\]

Noticing some winter cherry,  
well spread out[^2] and blossoming \[there\],  
plucking \[a flower\] from that tree,  
I \[then\] offered \[it\] to Phussa. (2) \[2153\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I offered \[that\] flower \[to him,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2154\]

In the seventeenth aeon hence  
there were three \[men named\] Pupphita,[^3]  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (4) \[2155\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2156\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kuṭajapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kuṭajapupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Arctic-Snow-Flower-er”. Sinhala *keḷinda*, aka Arctic Snow,
    Winter Cherry, nerium antidysenterica, as its name implies used for
    dysentery. See below, \#514 {517} for a different *apadāna* ascribed
    to a monk of the same name.

[^2]: the compound *vitthatasamotthaṭa* means “spread out and spread
    over;” I try to capture the reduplication with the qualifier “well”.
    The point is that it was a large, expansive vine

[^3]: “Flowering”.
