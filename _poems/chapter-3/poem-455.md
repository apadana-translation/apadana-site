*\[452. {455.}*[^1] *Akkamanadāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
I gave a \[plank for\][^3] stepping on  
to Kakusandha, the \[Great\] Sage,  
the Brahmin, the Perfected One,[^4]  
going during the siesta. (1) \[4823\]

Within the \[present\] aeon, since  
I gave \[him\] that donation then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of a foot-plank. (2) \[4824\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4825\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4826\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4827\]

Thus indeed Venerable Akkamanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Akkamanadāyaka Thera is finished.
