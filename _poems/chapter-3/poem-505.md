### \[502. {505.}[^1] Pāraphaliya[^2]\]

I saw the golden Sambuddha,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
who had entered onto the road,  
shining like a dinner-plate tree. (1) \[5420\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] *pāra*-fruit[^3] back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (2) \[5421\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[5422\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[5423\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5424\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pāraphaliya[^4] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pāraphaliya[^5] Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “*Pāra* Fruit-er”. BJTS reads *Vāra°*, both cite *Pāda°* as alt., but none of these is an identifiable fruit. BJTS Sinh. gloss just gives the Pāli *as* Sinhala, *vāraphalayak* (“a fruit \[called\] *vāra*). The lack of care/the disagreement about the name of the fruit (and hence of the monk) suggests, as does the poem itself, just a few strung-together repeating feet from the main text, that this is a “filler”. Cf. in this regard on the note on the name of the previous *apadāna*, \#501 {504}, that the present one is omitted in at least one mss. with its name supplied to the content of the previous one (which content is filled, in turn, with an *apadāna* already presented twice in the main text above!)

[^3]: BJTS reads “*vāra* fruit”

[^4]: BJTS reads *Vāra°*

[^5]: BJTS reads *Vāra°*
