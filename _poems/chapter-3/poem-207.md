*\[207. Salaḷamāliya*[^1]*\]*  
\[I saw\] Siddhattha, the Trainer,[^2]  
seated on a mountainside \[then,\]  
shining like a dinner-plate tree,[^3]  
surveying every direction. (1) \[2299\]

Gathering both ends of a bow,[^4]  
then I joined it with an arrow.  
Cutting a flower with its stalk,  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha. (2) \[2300\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2301\]

In the fifty-first aeon hence  
there was one \[named\] Jutindhara,[^5]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2302\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2303\]

Thus indeed Venerable Salaḷamāliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Salaḷamāliya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Salaḷa-Garland-er.” BJTS reads *salala°* . BJTS Sinh.gloss =
    *hora* = “large timber tree yielding rezin and oil, Dipterocarpus
    zeylanicus *(Dipterocarp.*)” (Bot. dict.).  
[^2]: lit., “Trainer of Men” or “Charioteer of Men,” *narasārathiŋ.* I
    adopt the shorter form here *metri causa. *  
[^3]: *kaṇṇikāra, kaṇikāra* = Sinhala *kinihiriya*, Pterospermum
    acerifolium, produces a brilliant mass of yellow flowers; Engl.
    a.k.a. karnikar, bayur tree, maple-leaf bayur, caniyar (now
    archaic?), dinner-plate tree; Bodhi tree of Siddhattha Buddha.  
[^4]: lit., “Having made a bow not two-fold.” The meaning seems to be,
    “having strung a bow”.
