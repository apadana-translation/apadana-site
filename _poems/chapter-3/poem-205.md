*\[205. Nigguṇḍipupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
I was dwelling in the ashram  
of Vipassi, the Blessed One.  
Gathering *nigguṇḍi*[^2] flowers,  
I offered \[them\] to the Buddha. (1) \[2290\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (2) \[2291\]  
In the thirty-fifth aeon hence  
there was one lord of the people  
\[whose\] name was Mahāpatāpa,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (3) \[2292\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2293\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Nigguṇḍipupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Nigguṇḍipupphiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “*Nigguṇḍi*-Flower-er”  
[^2]: a kind of tree, Vitex nigunda*.* Sinh: *nika*  
[^3]: “Great Cosmic Heat” or “Great Austerities”
