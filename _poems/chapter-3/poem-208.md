### \[208. Koraṇḍapupphiya[^1]\]
I saw the treading foot of the  
Great Sage, \[the Buddha\] Vipassi,  
who was going step after step;  
\[it\] was lovely, marked with a wheel. (1) \[2304\]

Seeing a *koraṇḍa*[^2] flower  
I offered it[^3] joined with its root.  
Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I worshipped \[that\] unsurpassed foot. (2) \[2305\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2306\]

In the fifty-seventh aeon  
\[hence\] there was one Vītamala,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2307\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2308\]

Thus indeed Venerable Koraṇḍapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Koraṇḍapupphiya Thera is finished.
