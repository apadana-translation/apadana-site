*\[36. Adhimutta\]*  
When the World-Chief Atthadassi,  
the Ultimate Man, passed away,[^1]  
with a mind that was very clear  
I summoned the monks’ Assembly. (1) \[1086\]

Inviting the Assembly-gem  
which was upright and well-settled,  
\[and\] having built a pavilion,[^2]  
I fed sugar cane to those monks.[^3] (2) \[1087\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
I surpass all \[other\] creatures;  
that is the fruit of good karma. (3) \[1088\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I gave \[him\] that gift back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of sugar-cane gifts. (4) \[1089\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1090\]

Thus indeed Venerable Adhimutta Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Adhimutta Thera is finished.  
[^1]: lit., “reached nirvana”  
[^2]: *maṇḍapa*  
[^3]: lit., “to that ultimate Assembly”
