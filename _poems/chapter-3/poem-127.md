### \[127. Phaladāyaka[^1]\]

I was a learned mantra-knower  
who had mastered the three Vedas.  
I lived in an ashram \[back then,\]  
not far from the Himalayas. (1) \[1840\]

I had offerings for the fire  
and some white-lotus-fruits[^2] as well;  
having placed \[these\] in a bag, I’d  
hung them on the top of a tree. (2) \[1841\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
with a wish for my upliftment,  
came up to me while begging alms. (3) \[1842\]

Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
producing \[supreme\] joyfulness,  
conveying pleasure to the world,  
I gave the Buddha my fruit. (4) \[1843\]

The Golden-Colored Sambuddha,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the Teacher, standing in the sky,  
\[then\] uttered this verse \[about me: (5) \[1844\]

“Because of this gift of \[some\] fruit  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
he’ll come to know no bad rebirth.” (6) \[1845\]

By means of just those wholesome roots,  
I did experience happiness.  
I’ve attained the unshaking state  
beyond \[all\] conquest and defeat. (7) \[1846\]

In the seventh aeon ago  
I was the king, Sumaṅgala,  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (8) \[1847\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1848\]

Thus indeed Venerable Phaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Phaladāyaka Thera is finished.
