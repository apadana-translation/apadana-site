*\[381. {384.}*[^1] *Pilakkhaphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
Seeing Buddha in the forest,[^3]  
Atthadassi, Greatly Famed One,  
happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I gave wave-leafed fig[^4] fruit \[to him\]. (1) \[3298\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I gave fruit \[to the Buddha\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (2) \[3299\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3300\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[3301\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[3302\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pilakkhaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pilakkhaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.
