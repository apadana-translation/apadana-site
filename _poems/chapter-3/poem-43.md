*\[43. Bhaddiya-Kaḷigodhāya-Putta\]*  
Sambuddha Padumuttara  
the Loving-Hearted One, Great Sage,  
the Chief Leader of Every World,[^1]  
approaches all the people \[there\]. (1) \[1168\]  
In that unsurpassed merit-field  
all were giving the Teacher \[gifts\],  
clothing \[or\] a place to reside,[^2]  
\[or\] requisites \[like\] food and drink. (2) \[1169\]  
“I too shall give an almsgiving  
to the God of Gods, Neutral One,[^3]  
inviting \[him\], the Best Buddha  
and the unrivaled Assembly. (3) \[1170\]  
Incited by me, \[others\] too  
did \[then\] invite the Thus-Gone-One  
and the entire monks’ Assembly,  
the unsurpassed field of merit. (4) \[1171\]  
I set out an expensive seat  
appropriate for the Buddha;  
a couch \[worth\] one hundred thousand,  
made of gold, with a woolen rug,  
a mattress, ornate woolen sheets,  
and with *khoma* and cotton \[cloths\]. (5) \[1172\]  
Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
the God of Gods, the Bull of Men,  
encompassed by the Assembly,[^4]  
did come up to my doorway \[then\]. (6) \[1173\]  
Going out to meet the Buddha,[^5]  
the World’s Protector, Renowned One,  
with a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind  
I spent time \[with him\] in my house. (7) \[1174\]  
With a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind  
I fed \[all of them\] with milk-rice:[^6]  
the Buddha, Leader of the World,  
and a hundred thousand monks \[there\]. (8) \[1175\]  
Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly,  
spoke these verses \[about me then\]: (9) \[1176\]  
“I shall relate details of him  
by whom this seat has been given,  
made of gold, with a woolen rug;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (10) \[1177\]  
He will exercise divine rule  
\[full\] seventy-four \[different\] times.  
Anointed by celestial nymphs,  
he will magically produce wealth. (11) \[1178\]  
He will reside upon the earth  
for a thousand regional reigns,  
\[and\] fifty-one times he will be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (12) \[1179\]  
In all the wombs in which he’s born  
he’ll be in an exalted clan.  
And he, after he has gone forth,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
will be the Teacher’s follower;  
his name will \[then\] be Bhaddiya.” (13) \[\[1180\]  
Binding \[myself\] to solitude,  
I make a remote bed my home,  
and all the fruits have been attained;  
defilements[^7] are now rooted out. (14) \[1181\]  
Knowing everything about me,  
the Omniscient One, World-Leader,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly  
did place me in that foremost place. (15) \[1182\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (16) \[1183\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Bhaddiya Kaḷigodhāyaputta Thera spoke these
verses.  
The Legend of Bhaddiya Kaḷigodhāyaputta Thera is finished.
