*\[85. Raṃsisaññika*[^1]*\]*  
On a Himalayan mountain  
I was residing formerly.  
Wearing deer-leather outer robes[^2]  
I dwelt upon that mountain \[then\]. (1) \[1526\]  
I saw the golden Sambuddha  
who had gone into the forest.  
He was like the hundred-rayed sun,  
like a regal *sal* tree in bloom. (2) \[1527\]  
Having pleased \[my\] heart in the rays  
of Vipassi, the Sage so Great,  
pressing hands together, squatting,  
I worshipped him \[bowing my\] head. (3) \[1528\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of perceiving rays. (4) \[1529\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1530\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Raṃsisaññaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Raṃsisaññaka Thera is finished.
