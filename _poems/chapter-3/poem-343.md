*\[340. {343.}*[^1] *Dhajadāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
The Teacher \[then\] was named Tissa,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men.  
Having seen his passing away,[^3]  
I hoisted a flag \[at that place\].[^4] (1) \[3093\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (2) \[3094\]

And \[afterwards,\] three hundred times,  
I ruled over the \[world of\] gods.  
And \[furthermore\] five hundred times  
I was a king who turned the wheel. (3) \[3095\]

There was \[also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting.  
I experienced own-karma,  
formerly well done by myself. (4) \[3096\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving a flag. (5) \[3097\]

Today, if I should wish for \[it\],  
\[the world\] with forests and mountains  
is covered by a *khoma* cloth:  
the fruit of[^5]what I did[^6] back then. (6) \[3098\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[3099\]

Thus indeed Venerable Dhajadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Dhajadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^3]: *tayopadhikkhayo* (BJTS reads, a little more cleanly, *tassopadhikkhaye*), lit., “the destruction (*khaya*) of his foundation (substratum, liability) for rebirth (*upadhi*).” I follow the BJTS gloss in understanding this as a reference to his *parinirvāṇa*.

[^4]: lit., “a flag was hoisted (or given, carried, displayed, etc.) by me”

[^5]: lit., “in” (*kate,* locative case)
