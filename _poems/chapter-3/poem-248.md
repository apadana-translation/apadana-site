### \[248. Pāṭalipūjaka[^1]\]

Back then I placed upon my head  
seven trumpet-flower[^2] blossoms;  
I offered \[them\] to the Buddha,  
Vessabhu, Supreme among Men. (1) \[2488\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of flower-*pūjā*. (2) \[2489\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2490\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pāṭalipūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pāṭalipūjaka Thera is finished.
