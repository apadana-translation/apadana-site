*322. Pulinapūjaka*[^1]*\]*  
Splendid like an arjuna \[tree\],  
like a bull of the finest breed,  
shining forth like the morning star,[^2]  
the Bull of Men lit up \[the world\]. (1) \[2831\]

Pressing both my hands together,  
I worshipped \[Buddha\], the Teacher.  
\[Then\] I eulogized the Teacher,  
delighted by my own karma. (2) \[2832\]

Gathering[^3] \[some\] very clean sand,  
I spread \[it\] on the path he took,  
having carried[^4] \[it\] in[^5] my lap  
for Vipassi Buddha, Great Sage. (3) \[2833\]

With a mind that was very clear,  
during the time for siesta,  
I sprinkled one half of that sand  
for the Biped Lord, Neutral One. (4) \[2834\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I sprinkled that sand \[at that time\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of \[giving\] sand. (5) \[2835\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2836\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pulinapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pulinapūjaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Sand-Giver,” cf. \#27 (where the name is spelled *Puḷinaº*)

[^2]: *osadhī*. RD (s.v.) points out that all we really know about this
    star is that it was particularly bright, leading Childers to
    translate it as “Venus” and others as the morning star.
