*\[170. Pañcaṅguliya*[^1]*\]*  
The Blessed One known as Tissa,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
the Sage, inside his scented hut,[^2]  
was wholesomely passing the time. (1) \[2099\]

Taking a garland and \[some\] scents,  
I went to the Victor’s presence.  
Quietly,[^3] on the Blessed One,  
I made[^4] a scented palm-print[^5] \[then\]. (2) \[2100\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I offered those perfumes \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of a scented palm-print. (3) \[2101\]

In the seventy-second aeon  
I was the king, Sayampabha,[^6]  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2102\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2103\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pañcaṅguliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pañcaṅguliya Thera is finished.
