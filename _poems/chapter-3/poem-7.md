*\[6.Upāli\]*

In the city, Haṃsavatī

the brahmin known as Sujāta

was very rich, with great vast wealth,

having saved eight hundred million. (1) \[446\]

\[I\] was that learned mantra-knower

who had mastered the three Vedas.

I had excelled in Saddhamma,

in reading signs and history. (2) \[447\]

A great many female renouncers,

with single top-knots, ascetics,[^1]

who followed Rishi[^2] Gautama,

were wandering around back then. (3) \[448\]

They then came and surrounded me,

thinking, “he’s a famous brahmin.”

The common people worshipped me

but I worshipped no one at all. (4) \[449\]

I saw no one worthy of *pūjā*;

I was fiercely proud at that time.

The word “Buddha” did not exist \[yet\]

as the Victor’d still not been born. (5) \[450\]

When \[many\] days and nights had passed

the Leader, Padumuttara,

Eyeful One, arose in the world,

dispelling all of its darkness. (6) \[451\]

When \[his\] dispendation had been

explained and spread to many folks,

then \[he\], the Buddha, did approach

the city called Haṃsa\[vati\]. (7) \[452\]

In order to assist others

the Eyeful Buddha preached *Dhamma*.

At that time his \[large\] retinue

extended for an entire league. (8) \[453\]

An ascetic named Sunanda[^3]

with the favor of the people.

then pleased with flowers everyone

in that Buddha-retinue \[there\]. (9) \[454\]

On a superb flowered platform

he explained the Four \[Noble\] Truths.

*Dhamma*-comprehension was reached

by a trillion \[beings who heard him\]. (10) \[455\]

For seven days and nights Buddha

rained forth a shower of *Dhamma*,

\[and\] when the eighth day then did dawn

the Victor spoke of Sunanda: (11) \[456\]

“This one, transmigrating in lives[^4]

in the gods’ world or that of men,

being most excellent of all

will transmigrate through his lifetimes.[^5] (12) \[457\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,

arising in Okkāka’s clan,

the one whose name is Gotama

will be the Teacher in the world. (13) \[458\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,

*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,

\[he\] will be that Teacher’s follower

named Mantāṇiputta Puṇṇa.”[^6] (14) \[459\]

The Sambuddha spoke in this way

to Sunanda the ascetic,

causing all the people to smile

and displaying his own power. (15) \[460\]

With hands pressed they showed reverence

to ascetic Sunanda then.

Acting in accord with Buddha

he purified his future state. (16) \[461\]

\[And\] this thought then occurred to me

on hearing the words of the Sage:

“I also shall act \[in that way\]

until I \[too\] see Gotama.” (17) \[462\]

Having thought in this fashion I

then considered the deed I’d do:

“what karma then should I perform

in this unrivaled merit-field? (18) \[463\]

This bhikkhu \[known as\][^7] Pāṭhika

is ranked first in the *Vinaya*

and all the recited teachings;

I will aspire to that status.” (19) \[464\]

I had immeasurable wealth

analogous to the ocean.[^8]

With that wealth I caused to be made

an ashram for the \[monks and\] Buddha. (20) \[465\]

That ashram, known as Sobhana[^9]

was built to the east of the city.

I spent a hundred thousand \[coins\]

\[then\] built that monastic ashram.[^10] (21) \[466\]

Constructing gabled cells, mansions,

platform stages and \[also\] caves,

and making a well-made walkway

I built that monastic ashram. (22) \[467\]

I caused a bath-house to be made

with heated rooms and a fire-room

beneath the water-storage hall

and gave it to the Assembly.[^11] (23) \[468\]

I gave everything \[they would need\]:

short chairs for sitting and recliners,

vessels for cooking and eating,

and medicines for the ashram. (24) \[469\]

\[Then\] providing it protection

I had a solid rampart built

so none would do it any harm,

\[a place\] for peaceful meditation. (25) \[470\]

I built that monastic ashram

with lakhs of quarters for the monks

and filling them abundantly

I \[then\] approached the Sambuddha. (26) \[471\]

“I’ve completed the ashram \[now\];

please may you \[therefore\] accept it.

I’m gifting[^12] it to you, Hero,

and the residents, Eyeful One.” (27) \[472\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,

Sacrificial Recipient,

discerning what I was thinking

\[then\] accepted it, the Leader. (28) \[473\]

Learning of the acquiescence

of the Omniscient One, Great Sage,

after the food had been prepared

I announced the time \[for giving\]. (29) \[474\]

When the time had \[thus\] been announced,

Padumuttara, the Leader,

along with one thousand arahants

\[then\] came to my \[splendid\] ashram. (30) \[475\]

Discerning the time to sit down

I entertained with food and drink.

Seeing that they’d finished eating

I \[then\] spoke these words \[to him\]: (31) \[476\]

“\[This\] ashram known as Sobhana

cost \[me\] one hundred thousand \[coins\]

and building it cost so much more;[^13]

please may you \[therefore\] accept it. (32) \[477\]

Because of giving this ashram

with intention and \[firm\] resolve

being reborn in lifetimes I

should receive what I’m wishing for.” (33) \[478\]

The Buddha, having accepted

that well-made monastic ashram,

seated in the monks’ Assembly

\[then did\] speak these words \[about me\]: (34) \[479\]

“This one who gave to the Buddha

a well-made monastic ashram,

I shall relate details of him;

\[all of\] you listen to my words: (35) \[480\]

\[He said\], “The army, with four parts --

tusker, soldier, chariot, horse --

will ceaselessly wait on this one:

fruit of a monastic ashram. (36) \[481\]

Sixty thousand instruments[^14] \[and\]

well-decorated kettle-drums[^15]

will ceaselessly attend this one:

fruit of a monastic ashram. (37) \[482\]

Women numbering sixteen thousand,

decked out in all the ornaments,

with varied clothes and jewelry

and wearing earrings made of gems, (38) \[483\]

with long eyelashes, lovely smiles[^16]

and slim waists, pleasant to look at,[^17]

will ceaselessly wait on this one:

the fruit of a monastic ashram. (39) \[484\]

He’ll delight in the world of gods

for thirty thousand aeons \[hence\].

A thousand times the king of gods,

he will exercise divine rule. (40) \[485\]

Whatever a god-king obtains

he \[too\] will receive all of that.

Not lacking anything at all

he will exercise divine rule. (41) \[486\]

A thousand times he’s going to be

the wheel-turning king of a country.

His reigns on earth will be many,

innumerable by counting. (42) \[487\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,

arising in Okkāka’s clan,

the one whose name is Gotama

will be the Teacher in the world. (43) \[488\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,

*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,

\[this one\] will be that Teacher’s follower;

his name will be Upāli \[then\]. (44) \[489\]

Excelling in the Vinaya,

skilled in right and wrong conclusions,[^18]

furthering the Victor’s teaching

he will live without defilements. (45) \[490\]

Having recognized all of that,

Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,

seated in the monks’ Assembly

will place him in the foremost place.” (46) \[491\]

Doing service beyond measure

longing for your dispensation,

I have \[now fully\] reached the goal,

in which all fetters are destroyed. (47) \[492\]

Just as a man tied to a stake,

fearing punishment by the king,

finding no pleasure in that stake,

would wish only to be set free, (48) \[493\]

so too am I, O Great Hero,

afraid of rebirth-punishment.

Being bound to the karma-stake

I’m scared of desirous feelings. (49) \[494\]

I find no pleasure in existence

being burned up by the three fires.[^19]

I am seeking liberation

like one punished by the king \[does\]. (50) \[495\]

Just as a person who’s been poisoned,

who’s wracked with pain because of that,

would seek after an antidote,

a way[^20] to destroy that poison; (51) \[496\]

and seeking, should he find a cure

that’s able to destroy poison,

drinking it he would be happy

\[to be\] set free from that poison. (52) \[497\]

Just so am I, O Great Hero,

like him struck down by the poison.

Pained because of \[my\] ignorance

I came for the *Saddhamma*-cure. (53) \[498\]

Searching for that curing *Dhamma*

I saw the Śākyan dispensation,

the best among all medicines,

by which all arrows are removed. (54) \[499\]

Drinking that *Dhamma*-medicine

I have destroyed every poison.

I have seen tranquil nirvana,

which does not age and does not die. (55) \[500\]

Just as one frightened by a ghost,

wracked with pain because of that \[fear\]

would seek after an exorcist[^21]

to free him from that ghost’s \[attacks\], (56) \[501\]

and seeking, should he find a man

with skill in exorcising[^22] ghosts,

that one would slay the ghost for him,

and wipe it out right to the root. (57) \[502\]

Just so am I, O Great Hero,

pained because I’m sunk in darkness.

I searched for the world of knowledge

that could free me from this darkness. (58) \[503\]

And then I saw the Śākyan Sage,

cure for darkness and defilement.

He drove out my mental darkness

like the exorcist does the ghost. (59) \[504\]

Diverting the stream of being;[^23]

he held back the craving-waters;

obliterating all rebirth

like the exorcist, to the root. (60) \[505\]

Just as a harpy who swoops down

on snakes to serve as his own food

will launch attacks from a great lake

a hundred leagues in each direction, (61) \[506\]

\[and\] that one, picking up a snake

would hurt it right beneath the head

\[then\] carrying it, take off \[again\],

flying about the sky at will, (62) \[507\]

just so am I, O Great Hero,

just as strong as is that harpy.

Searching for the unconditioned

I washed away \[all of\] my stains. (63) \[508\]

I have seen the superb Teaching,

the peaceful state, \[so\] unsurpassed.

Carrying it, I’m \[now\] dwelling

like the harpy with the serpent. (64) \[509\]

There is a vine, *āsāvatī*,

which grows up in Indra’s garden.[^24]

A single fruit is borne by it

after a thousand years \[have passed\]. (65) \[510\]

The gods are looking after that

as long as the fruit may last \[there\].

Thus indeed the gods do savor

that superb vine, *āsāvatī*. (66) \[511\]

For one hundred thousand \[years then\]

I did attend upon that Sage,

worshipping him morning and night

just like the gods *āsāvatī*. (67) \[512\]

Service which was never-ending,

\[and\] worship which was not empty;

for all the time that I had come

not one moment did he fail me. (68) \[513\]

I witness no re-becoming;[^25]

I’ve investigated being;

free of desires \[and\] fully free,

calmed, I’m wandering about \[now\]. (69) \[514\]

And just as a lotus flower

blooms due to the rays of the sun,

so too do I, O Great Hero,

bloom because of the Buddha-rays. (70) \[515\]

Just as male birds are not always

found mating with the female cranes[^26]

\[but only\] when the clouds do rumble

do they take them to their wombs, (71) \[516\]

and for much time they stay pregnant[^27] --

as long as the clouds don’t thunder --

then they are freed from that burden

when the clouds are raining \[again\], (72) \[517\]

\[so\] when the *Dhamma*-cloud thundered

of Padumuttara Buddha,

due to that *Dhamma*-cloud’s loud sound

I \[then\] conceived a *Dhamma*-womb. (73) \[518\]

Serving for a hundred thousand

\[aeons\] I bore that merit-fetus.

I was not freed from that burden;

the *Dhamma*-cloud did not thunder. (74) \[519\]

But when you, Sage of the Śākyas

did thunder from your *Dhamma*-cloud

in lovely Kapilavastu,

I was set free from that burden. (75) \[520\]

\[Then\] I explained the whole Teaching

and also its four fruits, which are:

emptiness, the absence of marks,

suchness, intentionality. (76) \[521\]

The Second Recitation Portion.

Giving service beyond measure,

longing for your dispensation,

I have \[now fully\] reached the goal,

the state of peace without rival. (77) \[522\]

I have excelled in *Vinaya*

just as had the sage Pāṭhika.

There is no one to rival me;

I further your dispensation. (78) \[523\]

I’m without any doubts about

the letter as well as the spirit

of both *Vibhangas*,[^28] *Khandakas*,[^29]

and the *\[Parivāra\]*, the fifth.[^30] (79) \[524\]

Skilled in rebuking,[^31] redressing,[^32]

in correct and flawed conclusions,

restoration[^33] and expungement[^34] --

I have excelled in all regards.[^35] (80) \[525\]

Citing the relevant sentence

in the *Vibhangas* and *Khandhakas*,

\[and\] disentangling both of them

I make suitable restorations.[^36] (81) \[526\]

Well-skilled in the Pāli language,[^37]

wise in what’s meaningful and not,

there’s nothing that’s not known by me,

foremost in the Teacher’s teaching. (82) \[527\]

I am now skilled in \[all\] matters[^38]

in the Śākyan[^39] dispensation.

I resolve all perplexities

and cut off every \[single\] doubt. (83) \[528\]

I am skilled in all the subjects:

prior clauses, subsequent ones,

in the letter and the spirit,

opening frames, concluding ones. (84) \[529\]

Just as a king with great power

who having rebuked enemies[^40]

and triumphing in \[his\] battles

might build a city in that place, (85) \[530\]

and he’d construct in that city

many ramparts, and trenches too,

gateways with strongholds and pillars,

and high watch-towers of various sorts, (86) \[531\]

and well-planned bazaars at crossroads

and places where four roads do meet,

and there he’d build a court of law

to settle meanings and lacks thereof. (87) \[532\]

To censure \[all\] unfriendly \[kings\],

to make known faults and faultlessness

and for protection he’d appoint

a general of the army \[there\]. (88) \[533\]

In order to protect his goods

he would appoint a treasurer,

one with skill in \[guarding\] treasure,

\[commanding\], “do not waste my goods.” (89) \[534\]

So that procedures are followed

he’d give the administration

to a friend, the king’s devotee,

desiring his prosperity. (90) \[535\]

He’d appoint as his adviser

one with \[much\] skill in reading signs

as well as omens which arise,

a learned master of mantras. (91) \[536\]

\[Thereby\] endowed with \[all\] these limbs

he would be called “a Kṣatriyan”.

Always they would protect the king

like a goose \[protects\] the injured.[^41] (92) \[537\]

Thus indeed are you, Great Hero,

a Kṣatriyan with slain enemies.

You are called the King of Teaching

in this world including the gods. (93) \[538\]

Having destroyed the heretics

and Māra with his army \[too\],

driving out that cause of darkness

you built a city of *Dhamma*. (94) \[539\]

Morality’s the ramparts there;

your knowledge, the gates and strongholds;

faith in you, the pillar, Wise One;

restraint, the sentry at the door. (95) \[540\]

Mindfulness[^42] is the high watch-tower;

you wisdom is the crossroads, Sage;

the superpowers, where four roads meet;

the *Dhamma*-road’s well-constructed. (96) \[541\]

Your court of law consists of the

nine-fold teaching of the Buddha,

the *Suttas* and *Abhidhamma*

and the whole of the *Vinaya*. (97) \[542\]

Emptiness, the absence of marks,

dwelling wanting very little,

desirelessness and cessation:

\[all of\] these form your *Dhamma*-hut. (98) \[543\]

At the top of those with wisdom

and skilled in understanding too,

the one known as Sāriputta’s

general of your *Dhamma*-army. (99) \[544\]

Wise in the four sudden events,[^43]

excelling in the super powers,

the one who’s known as Kolita

is your top adviser, O Sage. (100) \[545\]

Bearer of the ancient lineage,

hard to approach, of mighty power,

foremost in ascetic virtue,

\[Kassapa\]’s Prime Minister, Sage. (101) \[546\]

The learned bearer of *Dhamma*,

reciter of all the teachings,[^44]

the one who’s known as Ānanda

\[serves as\] your *Dhamma*-guard, O Sage. (102) \[547\]

Passing over all of those \[monks\]

the Blessed One did reckon[^45] me

best[^46] explainer of *Vinaya*

and gave my judgments \[authority\]. (103) \[548\]

Whatever Buddha-follower

raises some *Vinaya* question,

there without my even thinking

I relate the answer to that. (104) \[549\]

Throughout the entire Buddha-field

except \[of course\] for you, Great Sage,

in *Vinaya* there’s no rival;

where would someone better come from? (105) \[550\]

Seated in the monks’ Assembly

Gotama thus thundered forth \[then\]:

“There’s no rival for Upāli

in *Vibhangas*[^47][]{#Bookmark .anchor} and *Khandhakas*.” (106)
\[551\]

Teacher’s nine-fold dispensation

as far as the Buddha’s preached it

is all found in the *Vinaya*

for one who knows it to the root.[^48] (107) \[552\]

Remembering my \[past\] karma

Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,

seated in the monks’ Assembly

did place me in the foremost place. (108) \[553\]

Having served one hundred thousand

\[aeons\] while longing for this place,

I have \[now fully\] reached the goal,

excelling in the *Vinaya*. (109) \[554\]

I was formerly a barber

bringing the Śākyas happiness.

The son of the Great Sage was born

after I’d abandoned that clan. (110) \[555\]

In the second aeon ago

there lived Kṣatriyan Añjasa[^49]

of boundless might and measureless fame,

king of the earth, and very rich. (111) \[556\]

I was \[then\] the son of that king,

the Kṣatriyan named Candana.

I was puffed up with pride of clan

and pride about my fame and wealth. (112) \[557\]

One hundred thousand elephants

decked out in all the ornaments,

in rut in three ways,[^50] *mātaṅgas,*[^51]

waited on me all of the time. (113) \[558\]

Wishing to go to the garden

surrounded by my army, I

mounted the elephant Sirika

then headed out from the city. (114) \[559\]

The \[Lonely\] Buddha Devala

abundant in perfect conduct,

self-controlled with doors well-guarded[^52]

approached my city \[at that time\]. (115) \[560\]

Driving Sirika the tusker

I insulted that Buddha then.

Due to that, with ire arisen,

he would never lift his foot.[^53] (116) \[561\]

Having seen \[my\] tusker’s bad mood

I got angry at the Buddha.

Having harassed the Sambuddha

I \[then\] went into the garden. (117) \[562\]

I felt no pleasure in that moment

as though my head were set ablaze.

I was burning up with anguish

just like a fish caught on the hook. (118) \[563\]

I felt the whole earth was burning

all the way to the ocean’s edge.

Going to my father’s presence

I spoke these words \[to him just then\]: (119) \[564\]

“My insult to that Self-Become One

is like a very angry snake,

it’s like a mass of fire that’s come,

it’s like a drunk tusked elephant. (120) \[565\]

It’s awful that I’ve insulted

that Buddha, Victor, Fiercely Strong.

We’ll bring our cities all to ruin;

let’s seek the pardon of that sage.” (121) \[566\]

“If we don’t make him understand,

that Self-Tamed One, Self-Controlled One,

then on the seventh day from now

my country will \[all\] be destroyed. (122) \[567\]

Sumekhala the Kosiyan

and Siggava, so Sattuka,

after they’d insulted sages

came to grief, as did their armies. (123) \[568\]

Whenever sages get enraged,

well-trained ones who are celibate,

they cause \[the world\] to be destroyed

with its gods, oceans and mountains.” (124) \[569\]

I assembled \[all\] the people

throughout three hundred thousand leagues.

In order to discuss that crime,

I approached the Self-Become One. (125) \[570\]

Wearing wet clothes, bearing wet heads,

everyone pressed hands together.

Falling down at the Buddha’s feet

I spoke these words \[to him just then\]: (126) \[571\]

“Please show forgiveness, Great Hero;

the populace is begging you.

Please extinguish this awful fire;

and don’t destroy the \[whole\] country. (127) \[572\]

All the gods and also the men

and titans[^54] and spirits[^55] as well,

would constantly break my head open

with a hammer made of iron.” (128) \[573\]

“Fire does not survive in water

\[and\] seeds don’t germinate in rock;

worms don’t survive in medicine;

there’s no anger in a Buddha. (129) \[574\]

Like the earth, which is unshaken

and the ocean, beyond measure,

and the sky, which has no limit,

so the Buddha can’t be perturbed. (130) \[575\]

Great Heroes who are ascetics[^56]

are patient and forgiving \[folks\].

Such patient, forgiving people

do not consider your \[wrong\] course.” (131) \[576\]

The Sambuddha, having said this,

\[then\] extinguished that awful fire.

Then in front of everyone \[there\]

he flew right up into the sky. (132) \[577\]

Wise One, due to that \[bad\] action

I attained inferior birth;[^57]

\[now\] passing beyond that station,

I’ve come to the fearless city. (133) \[578\]

Then, Great Hero, \[having seen\] me,

well-settled \[but\] being burnt up,

that Self-Become \[Lonely Buddha\]

drove off the fire \[and\] forgave \[me\].[^58] (134) \[579\]

Even so today, Great Hero,

you have extinguished the three fires,[^59]

relieving me who was being

burnt up by those \[self-same\] three fires.[^60] (135) \[580\]

Let those of you with ears to hear,

\[all of\] you, listen to my words:

I’m declaring the facts for you

of how I came to see this state. (136) \[581\]

Sneering at the Self-Become One,

peaceful-hearted \[and\] attentive,

today, due to that \[bad\] karma,

I am born in this low-caste womb. (137) \[582\]

Don’t transgress even one moment;

you will grieve for the moment missed.

The moment is prepared for you:

endeavor \[now\] for your own good. (138) \[583\]

The poison \[called\] *haḷāhaḷa*

in some \[is cured\] by vomiting.

For some \[the antidote\] is purging,

for others medicinal herbs. (139) \[584\]

With reference to merit-field-seekers,

for those on the path \[the cure\] is vomit;[^61]

for those after path-fruits it’s a purge;[^62]

for the fruit-attainers, medicinal herbs.[^63] (140) \[585\]

Those who would oppose the teaching

are poisoned as with *haḷāhaḷa:*[^64]

a snake’s venom, poison eaten,

surely is going to harm[^65] that man. (141) \[586\]

Only once does *haḷāhaḷa*

bring about the end of \[one’s\] life.

After opposing the teaching

he burns for ten million aeons. (142) \[587\]

Patiently and non-violently,

with loving-kindness in his heart,

\[Buddha\] helps[^66] \[this world\] with its gods.

Therefore you shouldn’t oppose[^67] him. (143) \[588\]

Unattached to getting or not,

whether honored or insulted,

Buddhas are \[steady\] like the earth;

therefore they shouldn’t be opposed.[^68] (144) \[589\]

The Sage is just the same toward all,

Devadatta the murderer,

the thief Angulimālaka,

Dhanapāla and Rāhula.[^69] (145) \[590\]

They don’t experience anger;

passion is never found in them.

The Buddha’s just the same toward all,

a murderer \[or\] his own son. (146) \[591\]

Seeing a robe atop a tree[^70] --

discarded, smeared with excrement --

one should press the hands, head bowed;

that sages’ flag should be worshipped. (147) \[592\]

\[All of\] the Buddhas of the past

and the present and future \[too,\]

purify themselves with that flag;

therefore they ought to be worshipped. (148) \[593\]

With my heart I bear *Vinaya,*

almost the same as[^71] the Teacher.

I will always live my life \[by\]

paying homage to *Vinaya*. (149) \[594\]

*Vinaya*’s my inclination;

it’s[^72] my walking meditation.

I make my home in *Vinaya*;

the *Vinaya* is my pasture. (150) \[595\]

I have excelled in Vinaya,

skilled in mental tranquility.

Great Hero, Teacher, Upāli

is now venerating your feet. (151) \[596\]

I’ll wander village to village

and \[also\] city to city

paying homage to Sambuddha

and to the practice of *Dhamma*. (152) \[597\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (153) \[598\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (154) \[599\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (155) \[600\]

Thus indeed Venerable Upāli Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Upāli Thera is finished.

[^1]: lit., “ascetics who were wandering”

[^2]: all the manuscripts have “followers of Gotama \[some spell it
    Gautama\] Buddha,” but I follow the cty (which says they were all
    Jains \[*nigaṇṭhasāvakā*\] spouting varied views) and BJTS, which
    offers “Rishi Gautama” as the Sinhala gloss. This reading makes
    sense, given that Gotama Buddha was a hundred thousand aeons off
    still, and even -- at this point in the legend -- his predecessor
    Padumuttara Buddha had yet to be born. Indeed, verse 5 points out
    that there was not even the idea of “Buddha” in the world at that
    time. It is possible to take the term as referring to their later
    status as followers of Gotama Buddha, but the former interpretation
    seems much more fitting to the context.

[^3]: “Good Joy”

[^4]: lit., “in being” or “in existence”.

[^5]: reading *bhavesu samsarissati* (BJTS) for *bhaveussaŋsarissati*
    (PTS, sic).

[^6]: \#5 of *Therāpadāna,* above

[^7]: I follow BJTS and cty in taking this a personal name, which makes
    especial sense given the further reference to him in v. (78) \[523\]
    below. But it could also mean “a person on the road,” taking it as
    der. from *patha,* road.

[^8]: lit., “analogous to the unperturbable ocean”.

[^9]: “beautiful”

[^10]: *sanghārāma*, a Buddhist monastic residence, lit., “grove of/for
    the Assembly.” The wider connotation of *ārāma* is “garden” or
    “park,’ not precisely the same as ashram (Pāli *assama*) but closer
    than any alternative that occurs to me, so I adopt the Anglicized
    “ashram” to translate both *ārāma* and *assama.* I also sometimes
    translate these terms “hermitage,” as meter demands. I have tried to
    reserve the more technical “monastery” for *vihāra.*

[^11]: lit., “to the monks’ Assembly”.

[^12]: reading *niyyādessāmi* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS
    *niyyātessāmi*

[^13]: lit., “and was built with such a large amount”

[^14]: *turiya,* musical instruments

[^15]: *bheri*

[^16]: hasulā = ? Cf. RD *hasula*, s.v., which following Kern treats
    this as a corrupted reading of *bhamuka*, “eyebrows” or “thick
    eyebrows”, often found in combination with the term for “long
    eyelashes” (*aḷārapamha*).

[^17]: RD gives “good hips,” referring to this text. I don’t see the
    warrant, and take the term *susaññā* from *saññā*, sense,
    perception, as does BJTS

[^18]: *thānāṭhāne ca kovido*. This is one of the ten powers of a
    Buddha.

[^19]: cty here explains these as the fires of *rāga* (lust), *dosa*
    (anger) and *moha* (ignorance, folly)

[^20]: reading *upāyanam* with BJTS, cty

[^21]: *bhūtavejjaŋ*

[^22]: *bhūtavijjāsu kovida*ŋ, lit., “skilled in exorcisms of ghosts,”
    “skilled in the knowledges about ghosts”

[^23]: *saṃsāra-sotaŋ*

[^24]: lit, in the forest of the Cittalatā, the name of one of Indra’s
    gardens

[^25]: *paṭisandhi* = conception, reunion, following cty in connecting
    this with future existence

[^26]: *balāka*, a kind of small crane or *kōkā*. lit., “just as the
    males are not always found in the vaginas of female *balākas*...”

[^27]: lit., “for a long time they carry the fetus”

[^28]: lit “of the *Vinaya*;” BJTS and cty understand this to mean the
    two *Vibhanga*s of the *Vinayapiṭaka*: *Bhikkhu-vibhanga* and
    *Bhikkhunī-vibhanga.*

[^29]: that is, the *Mahāvagga* and the *Cūlavagga* of the
    *Vinayapiṭaka.*

[^30]: *tikacchede ‘va pañcake*; BJTS: *sanghādisesa tika
    pācittiyādiyehi da, pasvaeni vu parivarayehi da *

[^31]: *niggahe*: rebuking evil monks

[^32]: *paṭikamma*: cty: of monks who are unattained; a formal act of
    the *Saṅgha* against guilty *bhikkhus.*

[^33]: *osāraṇe*

[^34]: *vuṭṭhāpane*: cty: *āpattito vuṭṭhapaṇe nir-āpatti-kāraṇe*

[^35]: lit everywhere, *sabbaṭṭha*

[^36]: *rasato osāreyy’aham*. *Rasa = kritya*, function, what should be
    done -- in the abl? \[This section contains a lot of technical
    material that needs checking in the *Vinaya* texts)

[^37]: *niruttiyā*, in knowledge of the original dialect of the holy
    scriptures, which the BJTS Sinhala gloss explains as knowing the
    original meaning of words and understanding grammar.

[^38]: *rūpadakkho*

[^39]: lit., “in the dispensation of the Son of the Śākyas.”

[^40]: neither I, nor the mss tradition, knows what to do with “*tape*”
    here. The BJTS takes it to mean “army,” cty reads *tappeyya* (“would
    feel remorse”)

[^41]: *dukkhitaṃ*. Cty understands this to mean “its own relatives,”
    the other birds.

[^42]: *satipaṭṭhāna*

[^43]: *catūpapātakovido*. What are these?

[^44]: lit., “of everything in the dispensation”.

[^45]: reading *pamesi* (“measured,” BJTS, cty, PTS alt) for *pihesi*
    (“loved,” PTS).

[^46]: lit., “\[most\] learned”.

[^47]: see notes to \[524\] above.

[^48]: lit., “for one who knows *Vinaya* to \[or through, or with\] the
    root”,

[^49]: “path”. This spelling follows BJTS, cty and PTS alt; PTS reads
    Ajasa.

[^50]: i.e., showing their rut in their eyes, ears, and genitals. See
    cty, p. 288.

[^51]: see \#1, v. 25 \[164\]. Or glossary?

[^52]: this refers to the “doors” of the body’s sense-organs: eyes,
    ears, etc.

[^53]: lit., “the elephant did not lift his foot”.

[^54]: *asurā*

[^55]: *yakkhā*

[^56]: lit., “practicing austerities”.

[^57]: cty stipulates that this refers to his former occupation as the
    barber of the Śākyas.

[^58]: my translation here follows the BJTS Sinhala gloss on this
    grammatically-ambiguous verse, and the BJTS (and PTS alt.) reading
    of the final verb as *khamāpayi* (third person) for PTS *khamāpayiŋ*
    (first person); the ambiguity revolves around the term translated
    here as “Self-Become,” *sayambhuñ* (*sayambhuṃ*), which as a
    nominative (as in the BJTS gloss, and corresponding to the third
    person verb), should be *sayambhū* (would -*ū* ever become -*uñ* in
    *sandhi* with *ca*?), rather than this form which appears to be an
    accusative (*sayambhuṃ*, which would accord with the first person
    verb of PTS, but leaves the text asserting that the protagonist
    forgave the Buddha rather than the other way around); the -*uṃ*
    could also be read as a vocative form, but then the verse lacks a
    subject, since the first reference to the (present) Buddha is
    clearly in the vocative.

[^59]: cty here explains these as the fires of *rāga* (lust), *dosa*
    (anger) and *moha* (ignorance, folly)

[^60]: cty here explains these as the fires of *rāga* (lust), *dosa*
    (anger) and *moha* (ignorance, folly)

[^61]: cty: expelling *samsāra*, getting freed from *samsāra*

[^62]: cty: dripping, oozing out of *samsāra*

[^63]: cty: the medicine is nirvana

[^64]: lit., “it’s poison just like *haḷāhaḷa* for those in conflict
    with the dispensation”

[^65]: this interpretation of *jhāpeti* follows the cty.

[^66]: reading *tāreti* (BJTS, cty) for *tarati* (PTS).

[^67]: the term *avirodhiyā* (alt *avirādhiyā*) here and in the next
    verse is problematic -- to be taken as the optative of
    *virujjhati&gt;virodhati*?

[^68]: reading *na virādhiyā* (cty) or *na virodhiya* (BJTS) for *n’
    avirodhiyā* (PTS).

[^69]: the Buddha’s son, *Therāpadāna* \#16, below.

[^70]: I follow the cty and BJTS Sinhala gloss in taking *dumagge* as
    *duma + agge*. It would also be possible to take it as *du+ magge*,
    “on a bad road”. Here the former reading makes sense of the allusion
    to “flag” in the fourth foot.

[^71]: *kappa*, could also translate: “which is the practice of”

[^72]: lit., “the *Vinaya* is*”.*
