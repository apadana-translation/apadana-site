### \[7. Aññākoṇḍañña\]

Sambuddha Padumuttara  
was the Best in the World, the Guide.[^1]  
I saw him first, when he had \[just\]  
achieved that state of Buddhahood. (1) \[601\]

All around the Bodhi tree’s roots  
spirits[^2] were gathered together  
surrounding the Sambuddha, they  
worshipped, with hands pressed together. (2) \[602\]

All the gods had delighted minds;  
as they flew around in the sky,  
“This one has become a Buddha,  
Dispelling the Darkness of Night.”[^3] (3) \[603\]

A huge din was being produced  
by them overcome with laughter,[^4]  
“We’ll destroy our defilements  
in Sambuddha’s dispensation.” (4) \[604\]

Having heard the words of the gods,  
that majestic speech they uttered,  
I gave \[him\] his very first food,  
happy, \[and\] with a happy heart. (5) \[605\]

Discerning what I was thinking,  
the Teacher, Peerless in the World,  
seated in the gods’ meeting hall  
\[then\] spoke these verses \[about me\]: (6) \[606\]

“Leaving the world a week ago,  
today I reached Awakening.  
This one’s \[given\] me my first rice,  
a celibate monk’s sustenance. (7) \[607\]

I shall relate details of him  
who coming here from Tusitā  
presented this almsfood to me;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (8) \[608\]

For thirty thousand aeons he  
will exercise divine rule.  
Overpowering all the gods  
he will reside in heaven \[then\].[^5] (9) \[609\]

Falling down from the world of gods  
he’ll go into a human state.  
A thousand times a wheel-turner  
he will reign there \[for a long time\]. (10) \[610\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (11) \[611\]

Falling down from heaven \[again\]  
he’ll go into a human state.  
Going forth from the house \[and world\]  
he will dwell \[there\] for twenty years. (12) \[612\]

In the seventh year after that  
the Buddha will declare the truth.  
He whose name \[will be\] Koṇḍañña  
will be the first one to grasp \[it\].” (13) \[613\]

When \[he\] set out I \[too\] renounced  
and great effort was made by me.  
So as to destroy defilements  
I went forth into homelessness.[^6] (14) \[614\]

Approaching, the Omniscient One,  
Buddha in the world with \[its\] gods  
did beat the drum of deathlessness  
in the deer-forest named “Isi”.[^7] (15) \[615\]

He has now achieved deathlessness,  
the unsurpassed and peaceful state.  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
without defilements I \[now\] live. (16) \[616\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. \[617\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[618\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (17) \[619\]

Thus indeed Venerable Aññākoṇḍañña Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Aññākoṇḍañña Thera is finished.

[^6]: cty understands this seeming redundancy of “going forth” (*anupabbajan pabbajin*) to mean that at first he renounced as a non-Buddhist ascetic, and then he renounced as/became a Buddhist monk.

[^7]: reading *Isināme Migāraññe* with BJTS. The Buddha first preached the *Dhamma* to Kondañña and the others at the Deer Park in the Isipattana, near Sarnath.
