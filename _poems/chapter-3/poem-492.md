*\[489. {492.}*[^1] *Paŋsukūlapūjaka*[^2]*\]*  
In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named Udaka.[^3]  
There I saw \[the Buddha’s\] rag-robe,  
stuck up in the top of a tree.[^4] (1) \[5256\]  
Plucking three *kiṅkhani*[^5] flowers,  
\[that were growing there\] at that time,  
happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I offered \[them\] to \[that\] rag-robe. (2) \[5257\]  
Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (3) \[5258\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* to \[that\] Buddha,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[5259\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[5260\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5261\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[5262\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Paŋsukūlapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Paŋsukūlapūjaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Rag-Robe Worshipper”  
[^3]: “Water”. BJTS (and PTS alt.) read *Uddhangaṇo* (“High Clearing”),
    but this breaks the meter so I stick with the PTS reading of this
    (anyway likely mythical) name  
[^4]: I follow the cty and BJTS Sinhala gloss in taking *dumagge* as
    *duma + agge*. It would also be possible to take it as *du+ magge*,
    “on a bad road”. Cf. v. \[592\] above for a case comparable to the
    latter. Though I do follow it here, the cty and BJTS reading rather
    begs the question how the Buddha’s rag robes got up in the tree.  
[^5]: here as elsewhere, BJTS reads *kiṅkaṇiº*
