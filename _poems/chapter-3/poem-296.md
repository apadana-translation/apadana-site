*\[296. Padapūjaka*[^1]*\]*  
On a Himalayan mountain,  
I was a *kinnara*[^2] back then.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
\[bright but cool\] like a rayless sun[^3]  
who had approached me at that time,  
Vipassi Buddha, World-Leader.  
And then I rubbed upon \[his\] feet  
sandalwood and also incense.[^4] (1-2) \[2697-2698\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I performed *pūjā* to those feet,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of doing foot-*pūjā.* (3) \[2699\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2700\]

Thus indeed Venerable Padapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Padapūjaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Foot-Worshipper”

[^2]: the *kinnara* (Sinh. *kandura*) has a human head and a horse’s body; “centaur”.

[^3]: *vītaraṃsa*; see above, note to \#215, v. 1 \[2339\]. xxx should this, and the two sun metaphors in \#215, and again \#305, be treated as epithets? The distinction is taken to be the presence (or not, in the case of epithets) of comparative enclitics like *va, iva*

[^4]: a specific type of it, Sinh. *tuvaralā,* frankincense
