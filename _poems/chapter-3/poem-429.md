### \[426. {429.}[^1] Sovaṇṇakiṅkhaniya[^2]\]

Having departed \[home\] with faith,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
Wearing robes made out of bark, I  
placed \[my\] trust in asceticism.[^3] (1) \[4600\]

Atthadassi, the Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
came to be in that period,  
ferrying many folks across. (2) \[4601\]

\[All\] my strength was \[then\] exhausted,  
due to a serious[^4] illness.  
Remembering the Best Buddha,  
making an excellent stupa  
of sand, with a happy heart I  
scattered golden *kiṅkhani* blooms,  
by the thousands, \[on that stupa,\]  
my mind \[full of\] exultation.[^5] (3-4) \[4602-4603\]

As though facing[^6] the Sambuddha,  
I attended on that stupa  
with mental pleasure about \[him\],  
Atthadassi, the Neutral One. (5) \[4604\]

Reborn in[^7] the world of the gods,  
I’m obtaining great happiness.  
There I was the color of gold:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (6) \[4605\]

\[There\] I had eight hundred million  
women dressed in their ornaments.[^8]  
They’re waiting on me all the time:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (7) \[4606\]

There sixty thousand instruments,  
*bhera*-drums[^9] and *paṇava*-drums,[^10]  
conch-shells and *deṇḍima*-drums[^11] \[too,\]  
speaking the lovely sound of drums.[^12] (8) \[4607\]

\[And also\] eighty-four thousand  
elephants all-ornamented,  
*mātaṅga*\s[^13] rutting in three ways[^14]  
\[and\] tuskers sixty years of age,  
covered over with nets of gold,  
\[always\] are attending[^15] on me,  
and elephants equipped for war,[^16]  
are not \[ever\] lacking for me.[^17] (9-10) \[4608-4609\]

I am enjoying the result  
of golden *kiṅkhani*[^18] flowers.  
Fifty-eight times I exercised  
sovereignty over \[all\] the gods. (11) \[4610\]

And seventy-one times I was  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\].  
On earth, a hundred and one times,  
I exercised world-rulership. (12) \[4611\]

That one has now gained deathlessness,  
unconditioned, hard to perceive.  
The fetters have \[all\] been destroyed;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (13) \[4612\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I presented that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (14) \[4613\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (15) \[4614\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (16) \[4615\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (17) \[4616\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sovaṇṇakiṅkhaniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sovaṇṇakiṅkhaniya Thera is finished.
