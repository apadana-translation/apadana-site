*\[471. {474.}*[^1] *Sumanavījaniya*[^2]*\]*  
With[^3] a fan \[covered in\] jasmine,  
I fanned the superb Bodhi at  
the foot of the superb Bodhi[^4]  
of Vipassi, the Blessed One. (1) \[4981\]

In the eleven aeons since  
I fanned that superb Bodhi \[tree\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of a fanning. (2) \[4982\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4983\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4984\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4985\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sumanavījaniya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sumanavījaniya Thera is finished.

    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Jasmine-Fan-er”. Cf. \#375 {378} and \#462 {465} above for
    *apadānas* ascribed to monks with a similar name (in translation
    then name is the same, but in Pāli it is altogether different, and
    these are separate *apadānas*)

    (trumpet-flower) tree.
