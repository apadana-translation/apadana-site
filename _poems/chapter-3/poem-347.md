*\[344. {347.}*[^1] *Padumapūjaka*[^2]*\]*  
Close to the Himalayan range,  
there’s a mountain named Romasa.[^3]  
The Buddha known as Sambhava  
then dwelt there in the open air. (1) \[3117\]

Coming out of \[my\] residence,  
I brought[^4] \[him\] a lotus \[flower\].  
Having brought a single one  
I went forward into rebirth. (2) \[3118\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I offered[^5] \[him\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[3119\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3120\]

Thus indeed Venerable Padumapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Padumapūjaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Pink Lotus Offerer”. Virtually the same *apadāna* as this present
    one, ascribed to a monk with a similar name (*Padumadhāriya* *=*
    “Pink Lotus Bearer”) and differing only in giving thirty-one rather
    than ninety-one as the number of aeons ago when the good karma was
    done, and providing the full three-verse concluding refrain, is
    presented below as \#517 {520}  
[^3]: A recurring name in *Apadāna* of uncertain meaning  
[^4]: *dhārayim,* “carried,” “brought,” “had”  
[^5]: lit., “did *pūjā*”
