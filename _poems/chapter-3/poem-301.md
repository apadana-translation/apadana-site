### \[301. Padumakesariya[^1]\]

\[I lived\][^2] in the Sage-assembly,[^3]  
a fierce *mātaṅga*[^4] elephant.  
Feeling pleasure for the Sages[^5]  
I sprinkled \[some\] lotus pollen.[^6] (1) \[2717\]

Having pleased my heart among those  
Best of Self-Enlightened Victors,  
Devoid of Passions, Neutral Ones,  
I joyed an aeon in heaven. (2) \[2718\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I sprinkled that pollen back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of flower-*pūjā*. (3) \[2719\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2720\]

Thus indeed Venerable Padumakesariya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Padumakesariya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Pink Lotus-Pollen-er”

[^2]: lit., “formerly,” “in the past;” *pubbe*

[^3]: *isisaṅgha*. Cty equates these Sages (*isi*) with Paccekabuddhas, as becomes explicit in v. 2

[^4]: See \#1, v. 25 \[164\]. Or glossary?

[^5]: *mahesīnaŋ pasādena*, lit., “because of \[my\] pleasure about/for the Great Sages.” xxx Could also read: “at the pleasure of the Great Sages” or “because it would be pleasing to those Great Sages.” Cty only stipulates that the Great Sages are Paccekabuddhas.

[^6]: cty explains that he sprinkled this *reṇu* (pollen, dust) of lotus flowers on the Paccekabuddhas, presumably whilst they were meditating.
