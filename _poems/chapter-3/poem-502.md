### \[499. {502.}[^1] Ekapattadāyaka[^2]\]

In the city, Haṃsavatī,  
I was a potter \[at that time\].  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
the Flood-Crosser, Undefiled One. (1) \[5396\]

I gave to \[him,\] the Best Buddha,  
a well-fashioned bowl made of clay.  
Giving \[that\] bowl to the Buddha,[^3]  
the Honest One,[^4] the Neutral One, (2) \[5397\]

being reborn in existence,  
I’m receiving plates[^5] made of gold,  
and flat bowls[^6] made of silver, gold,  
and also \[some\] made out of gems; (3) \[5398\]

I’m enjoying \[all these\] dishes:[^7]  
that is the fruit of good[^8] karma.  
I am \[the owner of\][^9] bowls made  
for the famous and the wealthy. (4) \[5399\]

As with a seed which is planted,  
in a field which is bountiful:[^10]  
when it rains,[^11] with proper support,[^12]  
fruit pleases the cultivator;  
so too is this bowl-donation,  
\[well-\]planted in the Buddha-field:  
when it rains the joy-bringing \[rain,\][^13]  
the fruit will be pleasing to me. (5-6) \[5400-5401\]

As far as \[merit-\]fields exist —  
even the Assemblies[^14] and groups[^15] —  
the Buddha-field has no equal,[^16]  
giving \[great\] happiness[^17] to all.[^18] (7) \[5402\]

Praise to you, O Well-Bred Person![^19]  
Praise to you, Ultimate Person!  
After giving a single bowl,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state. (8) \[5403\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that bowl at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (9) \[5404\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (10) \[5405\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[5406\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[5407\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekapattadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekapattadāyaka Thera is finished.
