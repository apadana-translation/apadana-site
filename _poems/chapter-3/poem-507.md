### \[504. {507.}[^1] Ajelaphaladāyaka[^2]\]

The Sambuddha named Ajjuna[^3]  
lived in the Himalayas then,  
he Endowed with Good Behavior,  
Skilled in Meditation,[^4] the Sage. (1) \[5431\]

Taking a water-jug’s worth[^5] of  
*ajela*,[^6] *jīvajīvaka*,  
\[and\] taking umbrella-leaves \[too\],[^7]  
I gave \[them\] to the Teacher \[then\]. (2) \[5432\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that fruit at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[5433\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5434\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5435\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5436\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ajelaphaladāyaka[^8] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ajelaphaladāyaka[^9] Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “*Ajela-*Fruit Donor.” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *ageliphala°*.

[^3]: Arjuna

[^4]: lit., “skilled in *samādhis*”

[^5]: or “as large as an elephant’s frontal lobe:” *kumbhamattaŋ*

[^6]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *ajeliṃ*

[^7]: or, “umbrella-leaf” (plant). Both <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> place *ajela* or *ajeli* in apposition to *jīvajīvakaŋ*, which elsewhere in the text refers to a type of jak fruit, and to a type of pheasant, as well as to *chattapaṇṇaŋ* (“leaves \[lit., “leaf”\] for an umbrella”). <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinh gloss treats these as three separate items and infers “ands” connecting them; I follow its lead here. However, as all three terms are ambiguous (Cone cites only this passage for the term, with a question mark that it is some sort of plant or fruit), the translation must remain so as well, pending better identification of the three terms; the meaning may be “*ajela* \[type of\] *jīvajīvaka* \[jak?\] fruit \[and\] leaves for an umbrella” or “*ajela* fruit and *jīvajīvaka* leaves for an umbrella,” and so forth.
