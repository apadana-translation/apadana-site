*\[166. Sappidāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
The Blessed One then, named Phussa,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
Hero, was going on the road,  
making many reach nirvana. (1) \[2077\]  
After awhile the Blessed One  
came into my \[own\] presence then,  
\[and\] I, taking \[his\] begging bowl,  
gave \[him some\] clarified butter.[^2] (2) \[2078\]  
In the ninety-two aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that ghee at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving ghee. (3) \[2079\]  
In the fifty-sixth aeon hence  
there was one \[named\] Samodaka,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2080\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2081\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Sappidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sappidāyaka Thera is finished.
