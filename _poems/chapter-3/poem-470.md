*\[467. {470.}*[^1] *Nimittavyākaraṇiya*[^2]*\]*  
Plunged into the Himalayas,  
I’m reciting mantras back the,  
\[and\] fifty-four thousand students  
attended on me \[in that place\]. (1) \[4922\]

They all learned by heart,[^3] true knowers,[^4]  
were masters of Vedic science;[^5]  
having come of their own accord,[^6]  
they dwelt in the Himalayas. (2) \[4923\]

The Son of a God, Greatly Famed,  
falling from Tusitā \[heaven\],[^7]  
was reborn in a mother’s womb,  
attentive \[and\] remembering. (3) \[4924\]

When the Buddha[^8] was being born,  
the ten-thousand world-system quaked,  
\[and\] those who were blind obtained[^9] eyes,[^10]  
when the Leader was being born. (4) \[4925\]

This entire \[great bountiful\][^11] earth  
quaked in every manner.[^12]  
Having heard the sound of shouting,  
the populace was frightened \[then\]. (5) \[4926\]

All the people came together,  
and they came into my presence.  
“The \[great bountiful\] earth has quaked,  
what will this be the result of?” (6) \[4927\]

I answered them, “Don’t be frightened;  
there is nothing for you to fear.  
Let all of you be confident;  
this omen portends happiness. (7) \[4928\]

\[This great bountiful\] earth quakes through  
contact[^13] with \[one of\] eight causes.  
Likewise \[this\] sign is \[also\] seen:  
there’s a huge effulgence \[of light\]. (8) \[4929\]

Without a doubt a Best Buddha,  
an Eyeful One, will \[soon\] be born!”  
Having \[thus\] informed the people,  
I spoke about the five precepts.[^14] (9) \[4930\]

Hearing of the five precepts,[^15] and  
a Buddha’s birth, hard to obtain,  
happy \[and\] full of excitement,[^16]  
their hair stood on end in delight.[^17] (10) \[4931\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I explained the signs \[at that time\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of explaining. (11) \[4932\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (12) \[4933\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (13) \[4934\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[4935\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nimittavyākaraṇiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Nimittavyākaraṇiya Thera is finished.  
The Summary:  
Sālakusumiya Thera,[^18]  
Pūjā and Nibbāpaka \[too\],  
Setuda and Tālavaṇṭī,  
Avaṇṭa,[^19] Labuja-ppada,  
Pilakkha[^20] and Paṭibhāṇī,  
brahmin Veyyakaraṇaka:  
exactly two hundred verses  
are counted \[here\] by those who know.  
The Sālakusumiya Chapter, the Forty-Seventh  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Explanation of the Signs-er” or “Explanation of Omens-er”  
[^3]: *adhītā* fr. *adhīyati*  
[^4]: *vedagū*, i.e., those who have the higher or highest knowledges
    (*veda*) *as opposed to* (acc. to RD) those who are masters of “the
    Vedas”. The protagonist, in this case, is both.  
[^5]: *chalaṅgaŋ,* lit., “the six branches.” RD: “the set of six
    Vedāngas, disciplines of Vedic science, viz. 1. kappa, 2. vyākaraṇā,
    3. nirutti, 4. sikkhā, 5. chando (viciti), 6. joti-sattha (thus
    enumd at VvA 265; at PvA 97 in sequence 4, 1, 3, 2, 6, 5): D
    iii.269; Vv 6316; Pv ii.613; Miln 178, 236.” BJTS understand this as
    an adjective modifying “\[reading\] marks,” i.e., “the six branches
    of the science (*śāstraya*) of marks,” but given the use of the term
    to refer to the six branches of Vedic science above (\[3605\] = Sela
    (\#389 {392}), v. 24,  
[^6]: *sakavijjāh’*  
[^7]: lit., “body,” *kāyā,* i.e., the body he was born in and bore in
    Tusitā heaven, a “happy body”  
[^8]: lit., “the Sambuddha”  
[^9]: *alatthiŋsu*, PTS alt. *aladdhiŋsu,* BJTS *alabhiṃsu* all to
    *labhati*  
[^10]: or “vision,” *cakkhuŋ*  
[^11]: the lit. meaning of the term used here for “earth,” *vasudhā*  
[^12]: reading *sabbākāraṃ* with BJTS (and PTS alt as *sabbakāraŋ,* sic)
    for PTS *chabbikāraŋ,* (“six circumstances”)  
[^13]: PTS *samphassa,* BJTS *samphussa*, “touching on”  
[^14]: *pañcasīle*: to practice restraint from taking life, taking what
    is not given, sexual misconduct, false speech and becoming careless
    through the use of alcohol.  
[^15]: *pañcasīlāni*  
[^16]: *ubbegajātā sumanā,* lit., “excitement-born \[and\] good-minded”  
[^17]: *tuṭṭhahaṭṭhā āsiŋsu te*, lit., “they were all horripilating with
    delight”  
[^18]: reading *sālakusumiya thero* with BJTS; PTS gives *Sālapupphī ca
    yo thero*  
[^19]: PTS reads *Avaṭa*  
[^20]: PTS reads *Pilakkhu*
