*\[413. {416.}*[^1] *Ekadīpiya*[^2]*\]*  
When the Well-Gone-One passed away,[^3]  
Siddhattha, Leader of the World,  
all the gods and human beings  
are worshipping[^4] the Best Biped. (1) \[4391\]

And when a shrine[^5] had been set up  
for Siddhattha, the World-Leader,  
they’re worshipping the Teacher’s shrine  
as vigorously as \[each\] could. (2) \[4392\]

In the shrine’s vicinity, I  
lit a lamp \[for the Buddha\].  
I kept my lamp lit \[the whole night,\]  
until the sun rose \[the next day\]. (3) \[4393\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (4) \[4394\]

There my well-constructed mansion  
was known \[by the name\] “Single Lamp.”  
One hundred thousand lamps \[always\]  
are lit for me in the mansion. (5) \[4395\]

Like the sun \[when it\] is rising,  
my body is always shining.  
There is light for me all the time  
through all the light of my body. (6) \[4396\]

\[Right\] through walls, \[also right\] through rocks,  
\[and\] passing over mountain\[-top\]s,[^6]  
I am seeing, with \[my own\] eyes,  
\[even\] one hundred leagues \[distant\]. (7) \[4397\]

And seventy-seven times I  
delighted in the world of gods.  
And thirty-one \[different\] times,  
I exercised divine rule \[there\]. (8) \[4398\]

And \[then\] twenty-eight times I was  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\].  
There was \[also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (9) \[4399\]

Falling from the world of the gods,  
I was born in a mother’s womb.  
Even inside[^7] \[my\] mother’s womb,  
\[one of my\] eyes remains open.[^8] (10) \[4400\]

I went forth into homelessness  
when I was \[only\] four years \[old\].  
When eight months still had not elapsed,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (11) \[4401\]

I purified \[my\] “divine eye;”  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Every defilement is cut off:  
that’s the fruit of a single lamp. (12) \[4402\]

\[Right\] through walls, \[also right\] through rocks;  
I am seeing, passing over  
even entire mountain\[-top\]s:[^9]  
that’s the fruit of a single lamp. (13) \[4403\]

Uneven spots are even for  
me; darkness is not \[ever\] known;  
I don’t see \[anything\] darkly:  
that’s the fruit of a single lamp. (14) \[4404\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[Buddha\] a lamp back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a single lamp. (15) \[4405\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (16) \[4406\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (17) \[4407\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (18) \[4408\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekadīpiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ekadīpiya Thera is finished.
