*\[217. Tālavaṇṭadāyaka*[^1]*\]*

I gave a palmyra[^2]-frond fan

to Tissa, Kinsman of the Sun,

to quench \[him\] in the summer heat,

\[and\] soothe the burning \[of the sun\]. (1) \[2349\]

I am quenching the fire of lust,

\[and\] the fire of hatred as well;

I am quenching delusion’s fire:

that’s the fruit of \[giving\] a fan. (2) \[2350\]

My defilements are \[all\] burnt up,

every existence is canceled.

I \[now\] possess my last body

in the Buddha’s[^3] dispensation. (3) \[2351\]

In the ninety-two aeons since

I did that \[good\] karma back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (4) \[2352\]

In the sixty-third aeon hence

there was \[one\] named Mahārāma,[^4]

a wheel-turning king with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[2353\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2354\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tālavaṇṭadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tālavaṇṭadāyaka Thera is finished.
