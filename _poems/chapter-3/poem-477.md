*\[474. {477.}*[^1] *Giripunnāgiya*[^2]*\]*  
The Blessed One named Sobhita  
lived on Cittakūṭa[^3] back then.  
Taking \[some\] mountain laurel[^4] \[fruit,\]  
I worshipped[^5] the Self-Become One. (1) \[4996\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I worshipped[^6] the Buddha \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (2) \[4997\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4998\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4999\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5000\]

Thus indeed Venerable Giripunnāgiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Giripunnāgiya Thera is finished.
