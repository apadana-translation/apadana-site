*\[289. Buddhūpaṭṭhāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
Veṭambari[^2] was the name of  
\[the man\] who was my father then.  
Having taken \[me by\] my hand,  
he led me to the Greatest Sage. (1) \[2660\]

“These Buddhas, Chief Lords of the World,  
will \[all\] be pointed out to me;”  
I served them \[all\] respectfully,  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[my\] own hands. (2) \[2661\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I looked after the Buddha then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of providing service. (3) \[2662\]

In the twenty-third aeon hence  
there were four of the ruling caste,[^3]  
\[who\] were \[all\] called Samaṇūpaṭṭhāka,[^4]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (4) \[2663\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2664\]

Thus indeed Venerable Buddhūpaṭṭhāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Buddhūpaṭṭhāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Buddha-Server” or “Attendant on the Buddha”  
[^2]: the name varies widely amongst the manuscripts, perhaps because it
    seems to have no discernible meaning, beyond being his father’s
    name.  
[^3]: lit., kṣatriyans  
[^4]: “Servant of the Monks”
