*Metteyya Chapter, the Forty-First*

*\[398. {401.}*[^1] *Tissametteyya*[^2]*\]*

The ascetic named Sobhita

was living amidst the mountains,

near the top of a mountain slope,

eating \[only\] wild fruits \[he found\]. (1) \[3891\]

After bringing \[some\] fire \[and\] wood,

I am causing it to blaze up,

seeking the ultimate goal of

being reborn in Brahma’s world. (2) \[3892\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,

Sacrificial Recipient,

with a desire to lift me up,

did come into my presence \[then\]. (3) \[3893\]

\[Padumuttara Buddha\]:

“Why are you working, merit-filled

one? Give the fire \[and\] wood to me.

I will worship[^3] the fire \[and\] then

it will be[^4] purity for me.” (4) \[3894\]

\[Protagonist\]:

“You are very fortunate, Sir,[^5]

you understand, O divine one.[^6]

You attend to[^7] the fire \[for me\];

here then is the fire \[and\] the wood.” (5) \[3895\]

After that, taking the firewood,

the Victor caused the fire to blaze

without burning[^8] the firewood there:

a marvel \[wrought\] by the Great Sage. (6) \[3896\]

\[Padumuttara Buddha\]:

“\[This\] fire of yours is not burning;

your oblation does not exist;

\[this\] vow of yours is meaningless;

you should worship \[this\] fire of mine.” (7) \[3897\]

\[Protagonist\]:

“What sort of fire, O Great Hero,

is that one that you speak about?

You should tell that to me as well;

we’ll both worship that \[fire of yours\].” (8) \[3898\]

\[Padumuttara Buddha\]:

“Cessation of things with causes,

the burning up of defilements,

and giving up anger and hate:

those three things are my oblations.” (9) \[3899\]

\[Protagonist:

“What sort are you, O Great Hero?

What is your clan, O Happy One?

Your procedure for practicing

is extremely pleasing to me.” (10) \[3900\]

\[Padumuttara Buddha\]:

“I’m born in a warrior[^9] clan,

master of special knowledges.

All defilements are exhausted;

now there will be no more rebirth.” (11) \[3901\]

\[Protagonist\]:

“If you’re a Buddha, All-Knower,[^10]

Light-Maker,[^11] Darkness-Dispeller,[^12]

\[then\] I shall praise[^13] you, Divine One;[^14]

you are the Ender of Dis-ease.” (12) \[3902\]

Spreading out \[my\] deer-leather \[robe,\]

I gave \[a place\] for \[him\] to sit.

“Please sit there, O Omniscient One;

\[and\] I shall \[then\] attend on you.” (13) \[3903\]

The Blessed One did sit down there,

on \[that\] deer-leather, well spread out.

Inviting \[him\], the Sambuddha,

I \[then\] went \[into\] the mountains. (14) \[3904\]

Having filled up a shoulder-bag,[^15]

I brought \[some\] wild mangosteen[^16] fruit.

Having mixed \[it\] up with honey,

I gave \[that\] fruit to the Buddha. (15) \[3905\]

While I meditated \[on him,\]

the Victor then consumed \[that fruit\].

I brought pleasure to \[my\] heart \[there\],

gazing upon the World-Leader. (16) \[3906\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,

Sacrificial Recipient,

\[still\] sitting in my hermitage,

\[then\] spoke these verses \[about me\]: (17) \[3907\]

\[Padumuttara Buddha\]:

“He who regaled me with \[this fruit\],

\[feeling well-\]pleased by his own hands,

I shall relate details of him;

\[all of\] you listen to my words: (18) \[3908\]

Twenty-five times \[in the future,\]

he will exercise divine rule.

A thousand times he’ll be a king,

a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (19) \[3909\]

For him, endowed with past karma,

discerning what he is thinking,

there will be food and drink and clothes

and beds which are very costly. (20) \[3910\]

He will be reborn all the time

conforming with \[his\] good karma;[^17]

this one is going to be happy

and always free of affliction. (21) \[3911\]

In whichever womb he’s reborn,

\[whether\] it’s human or divine,

being happy in every place,

he will attain[^18] the human state. (22) \[3912\]

A scholar \[and\] mantra-knower,[^19]

a master of the three Vedas,

having approached the Sambuddha,

he’s going to become an arahant.” (23) \[3913\]

\[Protagonist\]:

As far as I recall my lives,

as long as I have had knowledge,

there is no lack of wealth for me:

that is the fruit of giving fruit. (24) \[3914\]

Attaining the supreme Teaching,

I slew \[all my\] lust and hatred;

all defilements are exhausted;

now there will be no more rebirth. (25) \[3915\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (26) \[3916\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (27) \[3917\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (28) \[3918\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tissa-metteyya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tissa-metteyya Thera is finished.
