*\[511. {514.}*[^1] *Ketakapupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
The Ultimate Person dwelt on  
the banks of Vinatā[^3] River.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
the Calm One,[^4] Very Composed One.[^5] (1) \[5473\]  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I \[then\] worshipped[^6] the Best Buddha[]{#BookmarkCopy1 .anchor}  
with a flower of the screw-pine,[^7]  
with a honey\[-scented\] fragrance. (2) \[5474\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that flower back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[5475\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5476\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5477\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5478\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Ketakapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ketakapupphiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Screw-pine Flower-er”  
[^3]: the BJTS spelling; PTS reads *VItthāya,* alts. *Vittāya, Cittāya.*
    Cf. \#380 {383}, v. 1 = \[3292\], above, where BJTS and PTS agree on
    the spelling accepted from BJTS here; but cf. also \#485 {488}
    above, v. 1 = \[5177\], where I also accept the BJTS reading amidst
    considerable variation
