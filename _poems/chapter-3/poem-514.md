### \[511. {514.}[^1] Ketakapupphiya[^2]\]

The Ultimate Person dwelt on  
the banks of Vinatā[^3] River.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
the Calm One,[^4] Very Composed One.[^5] (1) \[5473\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I \[then\] worshipped[^6] the Best Buddha  
with a flower of the screw-pine,[^7]  
with a honey\[-scented\] fragrance. (2) \[5474\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that flower back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[5475\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5476\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5477\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5478\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ketakapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ketakapupphiya Thera is finished.
