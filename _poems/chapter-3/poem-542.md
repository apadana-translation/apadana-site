### \[539. {542.}[^1] Kaṅkha-Revata[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the One with Eyes for everything,  
the Leader \[of the World,\] arose  
a hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[6056\]

Lion-Jawed[^3] and Brahmā-Voiced,[^4] his  
sound[^5] was \[like\] a swan’s \[or\] a drum’s;  
gait heroic \[like\] a tusker’s,[^6]  
very bright \[like\] the moon \[or\] sun, (2) \[6057\]

Very Wise,[^7] the Great Hero, the  
Great Meditator, the Great Friend,[^8]  
Greatly Compassionate,[^9] the Lord,  
Dispeller of the Great Darkness,[^10] (3) \[6058\]

the Three Worlds’ Chief,[^11] the Sambuddha,  
Sage, Knower of Beings’ Wishes,[^12]  
leading many who can be led[^13]  
whenever he preaches *Dhamma*, (4) \[6059\]

the Victor delighted[^14] people,  
praising amidst \[his\] retinue  
a hero, meditator, calm  
\[and\] undisturbed trance-loving \[monk\]. (5) \[6060\]

I then \[lived\] in Haṃsavatī,  
brahmin master of the Vedas.  
Hearing the Teaching, being thrilled,  
I aspired \[to attain\] that place. (6) \[6061\]

Then the Victor prophesied, the  
Leader, amidst the Assembly,  
“O brahmin, you \[should\] be[^15] thrilled, \[for\]  
you’ll attain that delightful \[place\]. (7) \[6062\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (8) \[6063\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
the one whose name is Revata  
will be the Teacher’s follower.” (9) \[6064\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (10) \[6065\]

And now, in \[my\] final rebirth,  
I’m born in Koliya city,  
in a well-off kṣatriyan clan,  
rich, prosperous, very wealthy. (11) \[6066\]

When the Buddha preached the *Dhamma*  
in Kapilavastu \[city\],  
being pleased[^16] in the Well-Gone-One,  
I went forth into homelessness. (12) \[6067\]

I had lots of doubts, here and there,  
\[what is\] proper, \[what’s\] improper;[^17]  
\[while\] preaching the supreme *Dhamma*,  
the Buddha resolved[^18] all of that. (13) \[6068\]

After that I crossed existence,  
then fond of the pleasure in trance  
I lived. At that time, seeing me,  
the Buddha said this \[about me\]: (14) \[6069\]

“Which doubts exist in this world or the other,[^19]  
\[whether\] known by oneself or else known by another,  
those who are meditators give up all that,  
living the holy life,[^20] energetically.”[^21] (15) \[6070\][^22]

Karma done a hundred thousand  
\[aeons hence\] showed me \[its\] fruit here:  
well-liberated, arrow-quick,  
I have destroyed my defilements. (16) \[6071\]

Then the World-Surpasser,[^23] the Sage,  
after seeing my love of trance,  
the Great Sage then appointed me:  
“foremost of monks who meditate.” (17) \[6072\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (18) \[6073\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (19) \[6074\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (20) \[6075\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kaṅkha-Revata Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kaṅkha-Revata Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Troubled Revata,” a historical monk so-named due to his scrupulosity about the Vinaya rules prior to attaining his arahantship. He was known as the foremost among those who are proficient in the trance-like meditative states called *jhanas*. See DPPN I: 474-475

[^3]: *sīhahanu*. BJTS Sinh. gloss on this curious epithet is *siṃhayakugē haṇu banda piruṇu haṇu ättē ya* (“he has a full jaw like the jaw of a lion”)

[^4]: *brahmagiro*

[^5]: the final component of this compound varies considerably in the texts; all the alternatives seem to indicate “sound” or “noise,” paralleling other forms of this adjective (e.g., \[5624\], \[5734\]) . PTS reads *haŋsadundrabhinisvano*, which is garbled*;* BJTS reads *haṃsadundubhibissaro*. I follow BJTS and BJTS Sinh. gloss *haḍḍa*. Presumably the meaning is that his voice was loud or resonated well. BJTS takes the first two components of the compound, *haṃsa* + *dundubhi*, as the name of a particular type of drum, “Swan-drum” (*hasbera*), though I find no indication of such an instrument in the dictionaries and so find more likely the translation here, that the Buddha’s sound was resounding like that of a swan or a drum -- loud but pleasant.

[^6]: *nāgavikkantagamano*

[^7]: *mahāmati*

[^8]: *mahāhito*. BJTS reads *mahābalo* (“Very Strong”)

[^9]: *mahākāruṇiko*

[^10]: *mahātamanisūdano* (BJTS reads, more coherently, *mahātamapanūdano*)

[^11]: *tilokaggo*

[^12]: *sattâsayavidū*

[^13]: *veneyyavinayaŋ bahuŋ*; BJTS tries to clean up the grammar with *vineyye vinayaṃ bahuṃ*

[^14]: *toseti*, lit., “is delighting”

[^15]: lit., “be” (imperative)

[^16]: *tadā pasanno*, lit., “then being pleased”

[^17]: *kappākappe*, or “permitted…prohibited” or “the rule…not the rule” or “suitable…not suitable”

[^18]: *vinayī*, both “removed” and “instructed”

[^19]: *idha vā huraŋ vā*, cf. RD, s.v. and his references to re-use of the phrase in poetry: S.i.12; DH 20; Sn 224 = J. i.96.

[^20]: or “wandering in celibacy”: *brahmacariyan carantā*

[^21]: pronounce all six syllables when chanting, or else read “\[most\] energetically,” to keep the meter.

[^22]: This verse is in a more complex 11-12-11-12 meter named xxx (reading *ye jhāyino tā* with BJTS for PTS *jhāyino tā* in the third foot, thereby preserving both meter and grammar.

[^23]: *lokantagū*, lit., “who has gone to the ends of the world” (understood by BJTS to refer to *bhavotpattiya*, the process of rebirth or re-existence itself)
