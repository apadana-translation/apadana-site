### \[265. Biḷālidāyaka[^1]\]

In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named Romasa.[^2]  
At the foot of that mountain lived  
a monk with senses \[well-\]controlled. (1) \[2557\]

Having gathered tuberous roots,  
I donated \[them\] to \[that\] monk.  
The Great Hero rejoiced \[in that\],  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One: (2) \[2558\]

“Tuberous roots you’ve given me  
with a mind that is very clear.  
Transmigrating in existence  
the fruit will be reborn for you.” (3) \[2559\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] those tuberous roots,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of tuberous roots. (4) \[2560\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2561\]

Thus indeed Venerable Biḷālidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Biḷālidāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Tuberous-Root-Donor”. Cty glosses *biḷāli* as *āḷavaṃ*, “potato”

[^2]: I am unclear about the meaning of this name. Cf. *roma*, body hair, *romaka*, feathered?, or *romantheti*, chews the cud. The mountain is named elsewhere (\#517) and the name is used also of a previous Pa<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">cc</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">chch</span>ekabuddha (\#279, \#347, \#433 {436}, below), and a rebirth-precursor of other arahants, too (\#226, above; \#299, below; in DPPN the name is *only* witnessed in *Apadāna* (plus one instance in ThagA i.399)
