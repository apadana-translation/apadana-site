*\[113. Saraṇāgamaniya*[^1]*\]*

The battle between both god-kings

\[had by then\] come into being.

A huge crowd was \[gathered for it\],

making a very loud racket. (1) \[1696\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,

Sacrificial Recipient,

the Teacher, standing in the sky,

\[then\] made many people feel moved. (2) \[1697\]

All of the gods were delighted;

\[their\] weapons and mail were thrown down.

Having worshipped the Sambuddha

they then stood off to one side \[there\]. (3) \[1698\]

Discerning what we were thinking,

the Compassionate, World-Knower,

uttered majestic words \[just then,\]

bringing many to nirvana. (4) \[1699\]

“One man with evil in \[his\] heart

might harm a single living being.

Because of that stain on \[his\] heart

he will be reborn in \[some\] hell. (5) \[1700\]

An elephant[^2] on the battle front[^3]

might harm so many living beings,

\[but if\] he cools off \[his\] own heart

he won’t be killed repeatedly.” (6) \[1701\]

\[Both\] of the armies of those two

spirit[^4]-kings were \[then\] astonished.[^5]

And they went to the World’s Best One,

the Neutral One, \[to take\] refuge. (7) \[1702\]

After \[he’d\] convinced the people,

the Eyeful One \[then\] rose upwards,

and being seen by \[all\] the gods,

he departed, facing the north. (8) \[1703\]

I was first to go for refuge

to the Biped-Lord, Neutral One.

For one hundred thousand aeons

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth. (9) \[1704\]

In the thirty thousandth aeon

there were sixteen chariot-bulls,[^6]

kings who turned the wheel \[of the Law\],

\[all were\] named Mahādundubhi.[^7] (10) \[1705\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[1706\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saraṇāgamaniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Saraṇāgamaniya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Refuge-Goer,” cf. \#23, \#298, \#356{359}

[^2]: the wonderfully-ambiguous term *nāga* could refer to an elephant,
    a cobra, a deity, the Buddha or a king, among many other things.

[^5]: reading *senāyo vimhitā* (BJTS) for *senā sāvimhitā* (PTS).

[^6]: I read the term *rathesabhā* as *rathe + usabh*ā, following the
    BJTS Sinhala gloss: *rājya-dhura-vahanayehi śreṣṭha vu* (“best among
    those on the vehicle which is the burden of kingship”)

[^7]: “Great Drum.” This reading follows BJTS for PTS *Mahāscunda*.
