*\[109. Biḷālidāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
In the Himalayan region,  
I dwelt on a mat made of leaves.  
Not feeling any greed for food,  
I was always happy back then. (1) \[1663\]

Digging up roots like *kaḷamba,*[^2]  
*biḷāli* and *takkaḷi*[^3] \[too\]  
\[I ate them\] prepared by adding  
jujube,[^4] marking-nut*,*[^5] and bel*.*[^6] (2) \[1664\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
discerning what I was thinking,  
came into my presence \[just then\]. (3) \[1665\]

Taking some *biḷāli* \[roots\] for  
the Great Elephant who had come,  
the God of Gods, the Bull of Men,  
I placed \[them\] in \[his\] alms-bowl \[then\]. (4) \[1666\]

The Great Hero then consumed \[them\]  
which made me extremely happy.  
After eating, the Omniscient One  
spoke this verse \[to me at that time\]: (5) \[1667\]

“You’ve brought pleasure to \[your\] own heart  
by giving me these roots[^7] \[to eat\].  
For one hundred thousand aeons  
you’ll come to know no bad rebirth.” (6) \[1668\]

This is my last going around;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
I am bearing my last body  
in the Buddha’s[^8] dispensation. (7) \[1670\][^9]  
In the fifty-fourth aeon thence  
the one known as Sumekhali  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (8) \[1669\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1671\]

Thus indeed Venerable Biḷālidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Biḷālidāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Wild-potato-Giver,” reading the name thus with BJTS for PTS
    *Bilā*°

[^2]: a wild potherb, Sinh. *wilpalā*

[^3]: neither of these is in *Pali-Sinhala-Ingirīsi Śabdakoṣaya*; BJTS
    Sinhala gloss explains them as types of wild potato (Sinh. *ala*),
    which is clear from the context too.

[^4]: *kolaŋ,* Sinh. *ḍebara*

[^5]: Sinh. *badulla, semicarpus anacardium*

[^6]: *billaŋ* = Aegle marmelos, Sinh. *beli geḍiya,* bael, bel, Bengal
    quince; bilva or vilva tree; also *billā, beluvā*

[^7]: lit., “this *biḷāli*”.

[^8]: lit., "Supreme Buddha’s”
