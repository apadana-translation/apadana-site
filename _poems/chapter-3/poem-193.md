*\[193. Khaṇḍaphulliya*[^1]*\]*  
In the great woods was a stupa  
of Phussa, the Blessed \[Buddha\].  
At that time there was a tree there,  
broken \[in half\] by elephants. (1) \[2225\]

Full of delight at the virtues[^2]  
of him Honored in the Three Worlds,  
smoothing out the uneven \[ground,\][^3]  
I offered \[some very\] pure alms. (2) \[2226\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] pure alms. (3) \[2227\]

Seventy-seven aeons hence[^4]  
there were sixteen Jitasenas[^5]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength,  
possessors of the seven gems. (4) \[2228\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2229\]

Thus indeed Venerable Khaṇḍaphulliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Khaṇḍaphulliya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Broken Blossoming-er”  
[^2]: lit., delighted by the virtues  
[^3]: lit., “making the uneven \[ground\] even”  
[^4]: lit., “in the seventy-seventh aeon”  
[^5]: “Victorious Army”
