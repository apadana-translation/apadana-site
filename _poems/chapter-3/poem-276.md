*\[276. Potthadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
I gave a plastering[^2] gift for  
the Gift-Worthy, Unexcelled One[^3]  
in the name of[^4] the Great Sage, the  
Teacher, and the Teaching, and monks.[^5] (1) \[2605\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a plaster-gift. (2) \[2606\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2607\]

Thus indeed Venerable Potthadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Potthadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Plastering Donor” (or perhaps to be read, “Bark-Donor,” see next
    note)

[^2]: *potthadāna.* The basic meaning of *pottha* is plaster, a mortar
    made with limestone, soil, cow dung and water (RD, s.v.). The poem
    gives no contextual reason to take it, as apparently do both BJTS
    gloss and cty (p. 471), as *potthaka*, “fibrous cloth” (cp. Sinh.
    *potta*, bark, which seems to be in the mind of cty when it
    explains: “it means that a cloak was given by me to the Triple Gem
    after pounding a strip of *pottha*, dampened *pottha;* rubbing it
    with a cow’s jawbone \[until it is\] the same \[thickness\] as a
    prepared cloak; taking measured threads; cutting them; \[then\]
    having a cloak woven with that thread for the sake of sitting upon
    or for the sake of carpeting.” BJTS glosses the term as *mā visin
    niyanda vatak dena ladi,* “a hempen cloth was given by me.” Given
    the association of *Apadāna* with the emergent *stupa* cult,
    however, the audience would easily have imagined the pious gift to
    have been a contribution of plaster, or participation in the actual
    work of plastering, rather than a gift of bark. On the other hand,
    in typical fashion, the name is reworked for the sake of meter as
    *Potthaka,* in the colophonic summary, which might support reading
    it as “cloth” after all. Cf. below, v. 176 of
    *Pilindavaccha-apadāna* (\#388 {391}) = \[3550\], where the term is
    definitely used for a type of cloth.

[^3]: *dakkhiṇeyye anuttare*, following BJTS Sinhala gloss (*kerehi*) in
    reading these locatives as indicating that the gift was “for” the
    Buddha. But these epithets could equally well stand in for the
    gift-worthy, unexcelled *stupa* of a Buddha, which is often
    represented in *Apadāna* *as* the Buddha himself, and would make
    sense of the gift of plaster, if that is the meaning of *pottha*. If
    the reference is to the living Buddha (as BJTS seems to assume),
    then plastering does not make sense, which may explain why BJTS (and
    cty) read it as a cloth instead.

[^4]: more lit., “with reference to,” “concerning,” *ārabbha*

[^5]: *satthā (= Buddha), dhamma and saṅgha,* i.e., the Triple Gem.
