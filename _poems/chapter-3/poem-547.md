*\[544. {547.}*[^1] *Abhaya*[^2]*\]*  
The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the One with Eyes for everything,  
the Leader \[of the World,\] arose  
a hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[6217\]  
The Thus-Gone-One exhorts someone  
in the going for refuge, \[and\]  
he exhorts someone in morals,  
in the supreme ten ways to act.[^3] (2) \[6218\]  
The Hero gives to somebody  
the ultimate fruit of monkhood,  
\[and\] likewise the eight attainments;[^4]  
he bestows the three knowledges. (3) \[6219\]  
Supreme Man[^5] urges some being  
in the six special knowledges,  
\[and\] the Lord gives to somebody  
the four analytical modes. (4) \[6220\]  
Seeing folks to be awakened,  
\[across\] leagues that can’t be counted,  
in no time having approached \[them\],  
the Charioteer of Men exhorts. (5) \[6221\]  
I then \[lived\] in Haṃsavatī;  
I was the son of a brahmin,  
a master of all the Vedas,  
revered as a grammarian,  
skillful in etymology,  
confident in definitions,  
verse-knower,[^6] ritual-knower,[^7]  
\[also\] clever at prosody.[^8] (6-7) \[6222-6223\]  
\[While\] wandering about on foot,  
having approached Swan Hermitage,[^9]  
I saw \[him\], the Best Debater,[^10]  
Honored by the Great Populace,[^11] (8) \[6224\]  
preaching the *Dhamma* without stain.  
I, with contrary ideas,  
after having gone up to \[him\],  
after hearing his stainless words, (9) \[6225\]  
\[looking for a word\] of the Sage  
which was incorrect, repeated,  
or[^12] thrown-off or without meaning,  
I saw none; therefore I went forth. (10) \[6226\]  
After not a long time, being  
confident among all teachers,  
I am taken as an expert[^13]  
in the subtle words of Buddha. (11) \[6227\]  
After having put together[^14]  
four well-written[^15] verses \[for him\],  
praising the Chief of the Three Worlds,  
I had \[them\] preached[^16] from day to day. (12) \[6228\]  
“In \[this\] frightful existence you  
are Free from Passion,[^17] Great Hero;[^18]  
out of compassion, you don’t die,[^19]  
thus \[you’re\] ‘the Compassionate Sage.’ (13) \[6229\]  
Someone who’s[^20] a common person  
not overwhelmed by defilements,  
\[would be\] attentive[^21] and mindful;[^22]  
thus \[Buddha’s\] inconceivable. (14) \[6230\]  
These are not destroyed by themselves,  
\[even\] someone’s weak defilements,  
consumed in the fire of knowledge.  
It \[would be\] a marvel \[if so\]. (15) \[6231\]  
He who’s the Teacher of All Worlds:[^23]  
for him the world’s thus a teacher;  
he’s thus \[known as\] ‘the World-Teacher’[^24]  
\[and\] the world is following him.” (16) \[6232\]  
With \[fine verses\] like those, I praised  
the Sambuddha,[^25] *Dhamma-*preacher;[^26]  
doing so as long as \[I\] lived,  
after death[^27] I went to heaven.[^28] (17) \[6233\]  
In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I praised the Buddha \[like that\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of praising \[Buddha\]. (18) \[6234\]  
I experienced a lot of  
great kingship in the world of gods,  
and local kingship \[here on earth,\]  
\[and\] wheel-turning kingship \[as well\]. (19) \[6235\]  
I transmigrate in \[just\] two states:  
that of a god, or of a man.  
I do not know other rebirths;  
that’s the fruit of praising \[Buddha\]*.* (20) \[6236\]  
\[When human\] I‘m born in two clans:  
the kṣatriyan or the brahmin.  
I don’t get born[^29] in lesser clans:  
that’s the fruit of praising \[Buddha\]. (21) \[6237\]  
Now, in \[my\] final existence,  
in Rajgir, ultimate city,[^30]  
I am King Bimbisāra’s son,  
and \[my given\] name’s Abhaya. (22) \[6238\]  
Influenced[^31] by an evil friend,[^32]  
I was bewildered by a Jain.  
Sent by the leader of the Jains,[^33]  
I approached the Best of Buddhas. (23) \[6239\]  
Having asked a subtle question,  
hearing \[Buddha’s\] supreme response,  
going forth, in not a long time,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (24) \[6240\]  
After praising the Best Victor,[^34]  
I \[myself\] am praised all the time.  
With good-scented body and mouth,  
I am endowed with happiness. (25) \[6241\]  
Thus indeed I am greatly wise,  
with sharp, clever \[and\] quick wisdom,  
and I \[speak\] with varied discourse,  
through the power of that karma. (26) \[6242\]  
With pleasure in \[my\] heart, praising the Worthy,[^35]  
the Unmatched,[^36] Self-Become[^37] Padumuttara,  
as the fruit of that, to a place \[full\] of woe,  
for a \[whole\] lakh[^38] of aeons, I did not go. (27) \[6243\][^39]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (28) \[6244\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (29) \[6245\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (30) \[6246\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Abhaya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Abhaya Thera is finished.

    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.
