### \[8. Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja\]

The Victor Padumuttara  
the Self-Become One, Best Person,  
did dwell in Cittakūṭa[^1] then,  
in front of the Himalayas. (1) \[620\]

I was \[then\] the king of beasts there,  
fearlessly going on all fours.  
Hearing the voice of that \[Buddha\]  
many folks were assembling \[then\]. (2) \[621\]

Picking up a blooming lotus  
I approached \[him\], the Bull of Men,  
\[and\] gave it to the Buddha when  
he’d risen from meditation. (3) \[622\]

I worshipped from four directions  
the Best Buddha, Ultimate Man  
and bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart  
I \[then\] roared out[^2] a lion’s roar. (4) \[623\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
sitting down on his own seat then  
uttered these verses \[about me\]: (5) \[624\]

Knowing that Buddha would speak,[^3] the  
gods all came together, \[thinking\],  
“the Best One, \[the Buddha\] has come;  
let us listen to his Teaching.” (6) \[625\]

The World-Chief, the Far-Seeing One,  
the Great Sage \[Buddha\] then explained  
the \[meaning\] of my roar before  
\[those gods\] overcome with laughter. (7) \[626\]

“I shall relate details of him  
who gave \[me\] this lotus flower  
and who has roared a lion’s roar;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (8) \[627\]

Eight aeons in the future he  
will be a wheel-turning monarch,  
possessor of the seven gems,  
a lord of the four continents. (9) \[628\]

He \[then\] will reign over the earth  
for four more than sixty \[lifetimes\].[^4]  
He will be known as Paduma,[^5]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (10) \[629\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama,  
will be the Teacher in the world. (11) \[630\]

This one will be a brahmin when  
the Buddha’s words are broadcast then.  
Leaving behind his brahmin-ness,  
he’ll go forth \[in the Buddhist way\]. (12) \[631\]

Being one bent on exertion,  
calmed,[^6] devoid of grounds for rebirth,[^7]  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled. (13) \[632\]

\[Though\] of a frightful clan of beasts  
\[living\] in the deepest forest,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (14) \[633\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. \[634\][^8]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[635\][^9]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (15) \[636\]

Thus indeed Venerable Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Piṇḍola-Bhāradvāja Thera is finished.
