*\[283. Paccuggamaniya*[^1]*\]*

With a mind that was very clear,

I went out and gave greetings to

Siddhattha \[Buddha\], World’s Torch,[^2]

the Physician for Every World,[^3]

the Bull of Men, who had arrived

like a lion in the forest,[^4]

like a bull of the finest breed,

splendid like an arjuna tree.[^5] (1-2) \[2633-2634\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I went to meet the Bull of Men,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of going to meet. (3) \[2635\]

In the twenty-seventh aeon

hence there was one ruler of men,

a wheel-turning king with great strength,

who was named Suparivāra.[^6] (4) \[2636\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2637\]

Thus indeed Venerable Paccuggamaniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Paccuggamaniya Thera is finished.

    up the world”

[^5]: *kakudha* (a.k.a. *ajjuṇa,* Sinhala *kumbuk gasa, kubuk,*

    thrives on the edges of tanks and lakes.
