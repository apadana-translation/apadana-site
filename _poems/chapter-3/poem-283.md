### \[283. Pa<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">cc</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">chch</span>uggamaniya[^1]\]

With a mind that was very clear,  
I went out and gave greetings to  
Siddhattha \[Buddha\], World’s Torch,[^2]  
the Physician for Every World,[^3]  
the Bull of Men, who had arrived  
like a lion in the forest,[^4]  
like a bull of the finest breed,  
splendid like an arjuna tree.[^5] (1-2) \[2633-2634\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I went to meet the Bull of Men,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of going to meet. (3) \[2635\]

In the twenty-seventh aeon  
hence there was one ruler of men,  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
who was named Suparivāra.[^6] (4) \[2636\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2637\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pa<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">cc</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">chch</span>uggamaniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pa<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">cc</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">chch</span>uggamaniya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Go and Meet-er”

[^2]: *lokapajjotaŋ*; I sometimes take this as a non-epithet, “lighting up the world”

[^3]: *sabbalokatiki<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chakaŋ*

[^4]: lit., “like a lion which wanders about in the forest”

[^5]: *kakudha* (a.k.a. *ajjuṇa*, Sinhala *kumbuk gasa*, *kubuk*, Terminalia arjuna) is an impressively large, shade-giving tree that thrives on the edges of tanks and lakes.

[^6]: “Good Retinue”
