*\[245. Kuṭidhūpaka*[^1]*\]*  
I was a watchman at the hut  
of the Blessed One, Siddhattha.  
Now and again I perfumed \[it\],  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[my\] own hands. (1) \[2478\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of worshipping Buddha. (2) \[2479\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2480\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kuṭidhūpaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kuṭidhūpaka Thera is finished.
