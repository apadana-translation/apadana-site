*\[108. Āsanūpaṭṭāyaka*[^1]*\]*

Plunging into a forest grove,

very quiet and undisturbed,

I gifted a lion-throne to

the Neutral One, Atthadassi. (1) \[1657\]

Taking a handful of flowers

and circumambulating him,

reverently serving the Teacher,

I departed facing the north. (2) \[1658\]

Due to that deed for the Biped-Lord,

the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,

I reached nirvana by myself;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed. (3) \[1659\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons

\[since\] I gave \[him\] that gift back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of a lion-throne. (4) \[1660\]

In the seven hundredth aeon

Kṣatriyan Sannibbāpaka[^2]

was a wheel-turner with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[1661\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1662\]

Thus indeed Venerable Āsanūpaṭṭāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Āsanūpaṭṭāyaka Thera is finished.
