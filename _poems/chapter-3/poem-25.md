*\[25. Annasaṃsāvaka*[^1]\]

I saw the golden Sambuddha

as he traveled through the bazaar,

like a rare ornament of gold,

Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks,

Siddhattha, the Lamp of the World,

Ineffable \[and\] Unrivaled,

the Tame one, the Brilliant \[Buddha\],

and I obtained supreme joy \[there\]. (1-2) \[969-970\]

Spending that time with him I fed

the Sambuddha, the Sage So Great.

The Sage, the Kind One, Protector

then rendered \[his\] thanks to me \[there\]. (3) \[971\]

Pleasing \[my\] heart in the Buddha,

the Greatly Compassionate One,

Supreme Consolation Maker,

I thrilled for an aeon in heaven. (4) \[972\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I gave that almsgiving back then

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of giving food. (5) \[973\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[974\]

Thus indeed Venerable Annasamsāvaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Annasamsāvaka Thera is finished.
