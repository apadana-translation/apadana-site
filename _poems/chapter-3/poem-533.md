### \[530. {533.}[^1] Mahākappina[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
was a Master of Everything.  
He rose in the space of the world,[^3]  
like the sun in the autumn sky. (1) \[5727\]

With \[his\] word-rays he awakens  
the lotuses \[called\] things to know.  
With his thought-rays the Leader cleans  
the muck \[known as\] the defilements. (2) \[5728\]

The fame of the rivals is slain,  
like firefly-light[^4] \[by\] the sun;  
he sheds the light of truthfulness[^5]  
like a gem \[reflects\] the sunlight. (3) \[5729\]

Like the ocean for gems, he is  
the future for the virtuous;  
like a rain-cloud for living things,  
he rains by the cloud of Teaching. (4) \[5730\]

I was a magistrate[^6] back then,  
in the city named “Haṃsa;”[^7]  
approaching I heard the Teaching,  
of the one named “Superb Lotus,”[^8]  
who was purifying[^9] my mind  
\[while\] explaining the virtue of  
a follower who’d done the deed,[^10]  
the admonisher of the monks. (5-6) \[5731-5732\]

Delighted,[^11] happy,[^12] having heard,  
\[then\] inviting the Thus-Gone-One,  
having fed \[him\] with his students,  
I aspired \[to attain\] that place. (7) \[5733\]

Then the Greatly Fortunate One,  
loudly as a swan or drum, said,[^13]  
“look at him, a great minister,  
skilled in examining \[cases\],  
fallen down in front of my feet,  
his body hair[^14] growing upward,  
rain-cloud-colored[^15] \[and\] broad-shouldered,[^16]  
with pleasant\[-looking\] eyes \[and\] face, (8-9) \[5734-5735\]

with an extensive entourage,  
bound for kingship, very famous.  
With kindliness[^17] he is wishing  
for the place of this deed-doer.[^18] (10) \[5736\]

Because of this alms-giving[^19] \[done\]  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,[^20]  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
he won’t be born in a bad state.[^21] (11) \[5737\]

Divine fortune[^22] among the gods;  
greatness \[when born\] among humans:  
having enjoyed that, through the rest,[^23]  
he will attain \[his\] nirvana. (12) \[5738\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (13) \[5739\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
the one whose name is Kappina  
will be the Teacher’s follower.” (14) \[5740\]

And so, having performed good deeds,  
in the Victor’s dispensation,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (15) \[5741\]

Having commanded righteously[^24]  
\[both\] divine and human kingdoms,  
I was born close to Benares,  
in a clan of servants who weave.[^25] (16) \[5742\]

With a following of thousands,  
together with \[my\] chief queen, I  
\[then\] attended on five hundred  
Buddhas enlightened by themselves.[^26] (17) \[5743\]

Having fed \[them\] for three months, we[^27]  
afterward gave \[them\] the three robes.  
Fallen from there we all of us  
arose among the thirty \[gods\].[^28] (18) \[5744\]

Fallen from there we all came back  
to human existence again.  
We’re born[^29] in Kukkuṭa city,  
to the side of Himalaya. (19) \[5745\]

My name \[at birth\] was Kappina;  
son of the king, very famous.  
The rest were born in a clan of  
ministers; they waited on me. (20) \[5746\]

The comfort of kingship[^30] attained,  
I was rich in every pleasure.  
Told by merchants, I got to know,[^31]  
that the Buddha had arisen: (21) \[5747\]

“A Buddha’s risen in the world;  
Unequaled,[^32] the Single Person,[^33]  
he’s declaring the great Teaching:  
ultimate, deathless comfort. (22) \[5748\]

And his students are well-engaged,  
well-liberated, undefiled.”  
After hearing that good word, \[and\]  
paying respect to the merchants, (23) \[5749\]

quitting[^34] kingship, with ministers,  
I left, devoted to Buddha.[^35]  
Seeing the great Canda River[^36] —  
full \[of water\] with level banks,  
a little rough, without supports,  
a rushing current hard to cross —  
recalling the Buddha’s virtue,  
I got across \[it\] in safety. (24-25) \[5750-5751\]

“If \[he\] Crossed the stream of being,  
Buddha, Knower, World’s-End-Goer,  
due to the truthfulness of that,  
let my journey be a success! (26) \[5752\]

If the Path is going to peace,  
and release is peaceful comfort,  
due to the truthfulness of that,  
let my journey be a success! (27) \[5753\]

If the monks[^37] have crossed the wasteland,  
the unsurpassed field of merit,  
due to the truthfulness of that,  
let my journey be a success!” (28) \[5754\]

When that truth-wish[^38] had been performed,  
the water went off from the road.  
Thus in safety I crossed over  
to the river’s beautiful bank. (29) \[5755\]

I saw the Buddha sitting down,  
like the sun \[when it\] is rising,  
blazing like a mountain of gold,  
shining forth like a tree of lamps, (30) \[5756\]

surrounded by \[his\] followers  
like the moon along with the stars,  
like the king of gods[^39] raining forth  
the gladdening sermon-water. (31) \[5757\]

Worshipping with the ministers,  
I went up to \[him\] on one side,  
\[and\] then, discerning \[what\] we wished,  
the Buddha preached the *Dhamma* \[there\]. (32) \[5758\]

Having heard the stainless Teaching,  
we \[then\] said \[this\] to the Victor:  
“O Great Sage, please \[now\] ordain \[us\],  
we’re disgusted with existence.” (33) \[5759\]

“Well-preached, O monks, is the *Dhamma*,  
for you to make suffering end;  
wander forth in celibacy,”  
thus \[indeed\] spoke the Seventh Sage. (34) \[5760\]

When that was spoken, all of us  
took on the appearance of monks;  
we were \[all then\] fully ordained  
stream-enterers in the teachings.[^40] (35) \[5761\]

Then going to Jetavana,  
the Guide gave instruction \[to us\].  
\[Thus\] instructed by the Victor,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (36) \[5762\]

Thereafter I admonished them,[^41]  
the thousand monks \[along with me\].  
\[Then\], because of my instruction,  
they too were freed from defilements.[^42] (37) \[5763\]

The Victor, pleased[^43] by[^44] that virtue,  
\[then\] placed in that foremost place,  
“Among the monk-admonishers,  
Kappina’s top,” \[he told\] the folk. (38) \[5764\]

Karma done a hundred thousand  
\[aeons hence\] showed me \[its\] fruit here:  
well-liberated, arrow-quick,  
I have destroyed my defilements. (39) \[5765\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (40) \[5766\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (41) \[5767\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (42) \[5768\]

Thus indeed Venerable Mahākappina Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Mahākappina Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: A historical monk, foremost among those who instruct (admonish, teach) the monks *(bhikkhuovādakānaṃ*) (and the nuns: see DPPN II:473-475, which uncharacteristically does not mention *Apadāna*).

[^3]: reading *jagadākāse* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *jaladākāse* (“in the space of a rain-cloud”)

[^4]: see Cone s.v. for *khajjota-ābhā*

[^5]: reading *saccatthābhaṃ pakāseti* for *sabbatthaŋ*

[^6]: *akkhadasso*, RD “one who examines the dice, an upmire, a judge” Cone s.v. a judge, a magistrate, very clear in the commentarial passage she cites; “assessor” is Malalasekara’s translation

[^7]: “Swan,” i.e., Haṃsavatī

[^8]: *jalajuttamanāmino*, i.e. Padumuttara Buddha

[^9]: or “perfuming,” “cleaning,” *vāsayantassa*

[^10]: *katāvino*, i.e., an arahant

[^11]: *patīto*

[^12]: *sumano*

[^13]: reading BJTS *tadāhāsi mahābhāgo haṃsadundubhisussaro* with BJTS for PTS’ garbled *tadā haŋsasamābhāgo haŋsadundubhinīvaco*

[^14]: *°tanūruhaŋ*, see Buddhadatta *Pāli-Sinhala Akārādiya*, s.v.

[^15]: PTS *jimuttavaṇṇaŋ*, BJTS *jīmūtavaṇṇaṃ*, read *jīmutavaṇṇaṃ* and see see Buddhadatta *Pāli-Sinhala Akārādiya*, *jīmuta*, s.v. BJTS Sinhala gloss concurs: *meghavarṇa vū*

[^16]: lit., “fat-shoulders”. BJTS reads *pīṇ°* but understands the adjective in the same way: “having shoulders whihc are full (covered with meat)

[^17]: *muditāya*, “with disinterested love”

[^18]: *katāvino*, i.e., arahant.

[^19]: reading *piṇḍapātena* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *paṇipātena* (“because of this prostration” “because of this adoration”)

[^20]: reading *cetanāpaṇidhīhi ca* with BJTS (and this is a recurring foot throughout *Apadāna*) for PTS *cāgena paṇidhīhi ca* (“with generosity and resolve”)

[^21]: or “he won’t be reborn in a bad rebirth” (*n’upapajjati duggatiŋ*)

[^22]: PTS *sobhāgyaŋ*, BJTS *sobhaggaṃ*

[^23]: i.e., through the remainder of the good karma

[^24]: *sutaso anusāsiya*, following cty (p. 504: “the meaning is: having commanded righteously with equal words and on the basis of reasons”). BJTS reads *sataso* and takes it (in the gloss) as *siyavarak* (“a hundred times”) though it also includes the commentarial gloss “righteously and slowly” (*dähämin semin*)

[^25]: *jāto keniyajātiyā*. Malalasekera takes this as a mistake for *koliyajātiyā* (in a Koiiyan clan), the corresponding reading in ThagA, but cty. explains the term as *tantavāyajātiyā pesakārakūla* (“in a weaver’s cast, a clan of servants”); BJTS Sinh. gloss and Cone, s.v., adopt the latter reading, though PTS apparently treats this as a proper name (perhaps recalling the use of this as a proper name in \#389 {392}, v. 26 \[3607\] et passim). The context suggests that in this birth he was a king, so this would be an instance of lower caste kingship if the cty. reading is accepted.

[^26]: *pañcapaccekabuddhānaŋ satāni*

[^27]: reading *adamha* with BJTS for PTS *dammi*

[^28]: *tidasūpagā*, i.e the thirty-three gods, in Tāvatiṃsa heaven

[^29]: reading *jātā* with BJTS for PTS *jāto* (“I was born”)

[^30]: *mahārajjaŋ*, lit., “of overlordship,” “of powerful kingship” “of being a maharajah”

[^31]: *apāpuṇiŋ*. BJTS reads *ahaṃ suṇiṃ*, “I heard”

[^32]: *asamo*

[^33]: *ekapuggalo*

[^34]: reading *pahāya* with BJTS for PTS *vihāya* (“having worked”)

[^35]: *buddhamāmaka*, lit., “taking Buddha as ‘mine’”

[^36]: that is, the Candabhāgā

[^37]: lit., “if the assembly (*saṅgha*)”

[^38]: *saccavare*, “wish \[because of\] truth,” cf. *saccakiriya*, “act of truth”

[^39]: *vāsavaŋ viya*, = Sakka, Indra

[^40]: *sotāpaṇṇā ca sāsane*, lit., ”and stream-enterers in the dispensation”

[^41]: lit., “it,” singular, standing in for “the \[group\] of a thousand monks”

[^42]: *te pi āsuŋ anāsavā*
