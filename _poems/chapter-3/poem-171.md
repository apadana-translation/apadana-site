*Kumuda Chapter, the Eighteenth*

*\[171. Kumudamāliya*[^1]*\]*

In the Himalayan Mountains,

there was a large, natural lake.

I was a *rakkhasa* born there,

of frightful form, having great strength. (1) \[2104\]

White lotuses were blooming there,

arising just as big as wheels,[^2]

and I \[then\] picked those[^3] lotuses.

The Strong One’s[^4] group[^5] was \[there\] then \[too\]. (2) \[2105\]

But Atthadassi, Blessed One,

the Biped-Lord, the Bull of Men,

seeing that those flowers were picked,[^6]

did come into my presence \[then\]. (3) \[2106\]

The God of Gods, the Bull of Men,

the Sambuddha approached \[me then\].

Picking up all of those flowers

I gave \[them all\] to the Buddha. (4) \[2107\]

That company then \[stretched\] out to

the ends of the Himalayas.[^7]

With a canopy \[over\] him[^8]

the Thus-Gone-One did journey forth. (5) \[2108\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons

since I offered \[that\] flower \[to him\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (6) \[2109\]

In the fifteenth aeon ago,

there were seven lords of people,

wheel-turning kings with great power,

\[all\] known as Sahassaratha.[^9] (7) \[2110\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[2111\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kumudamāliya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kumudamāliya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “White-Lotus-Garland-er”

[^2]: BJTS Sinhala gloss takes this measure to be that of a chariot
    wheel (*riya-sak*), in which case they were very large lotuses
    indeed.

[^3]: reading *taṃ* (BJTS) for *ahaŋ* (“I,” PTS).

[^4]: I follow BJTS in reading *balino* for *phalino* (“of the one
    bearing fruit,” PTS), though neither *balī* nor *phalī* is one of
    the regular Buddha-epithets in *Apadāna*, so the choice is somewhat
    arbitrary: the Buddha might as well be “the Fruitful One” as “the
    Strong One”.

[^5]: *Samiti*, which BJTS Sinhala gloss takes to mean the Assembly of
    monks, i.e., the Buddha and his monastic followers

[^6]: reading *samocitaṃ* (BJTS) for *saṅkocitaŋ* (PTS).

[^7]: reading *yāvatā himavantantā parisā sā tadā ahu* (BJTS) for
    *yāvatā himavantato yāva samantato ahu* (“as far as the ends of the
    Himalayas, on all sides there was,” PTS)

[^8]: reading *tācchadanasampanno* ("endowed with a canopy \[on top of\]
    him”) with BJTS for PTS *aggacchadanasampanno* (“with a canopy on
    top \[on top of him\]”)

[^9]: “Thousand Chariots”.
