### \[146. Anulepadāyaka[^1]\]

I made the Bodhi-railing[^2] of  
the \[Great\] Sage, Anomadassi.  
After giving balls of plaster,  
I did \[all of\] the work by hand. (1) \[1966\]

Anomadassi, the Best Man,  
the Teacher, seated with the monks,[^3]  
having seen that work so well done,  
\[then\] uttered this verse \[about me\]: (2) \[1967\]

“Because of this plastering work,  
and \[his\] intention[^4] and resolve,  
after enjoying happiness,  
he’ll make an end to suffering.” (3) \[1968\]

\[My\] complexion \[shows my\] pleasure;  
I’m tranquil and well-self-controlled.  
I am bearing my last body  
in the Buddha’s[^5] dispensation. (4) \[1969\]

When the hundredth aeon ago  
and no less had been completed,  
I was[^6] named King Sabbagghana,[^7]  
a wheel-turner with great power. (5) \[1970\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1971\]

Thus indeed Venerable Anulepadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Anulepadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Plastering-Donor.” I follow <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>, cty, <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> alt, in reading the name as such. <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> gives Anulomadāyaka, “Suitable Donor”.

[^2]: that is, the railing around the Bodhi Tree.

[^6]: reading *āsiṃ* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) for *āsi* (‘there was,” <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>), though the text is inconsistent in the use of first or third person verbs in this formulaic phrase.

[^7]: “All-Valuable-er” or “Worth it All”
