*\[146. Anulepadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
I made the Bodhi-railing[^2] of  
the \[Great\] Sage, Anomadassi.  
After giving balls of plaster,  
I did \[all of\] the work by hand. (1) \[1966\]  
Anomadassi, the Best Man,  
the Teacher, seated with the monks,[^3]  
having seen that work so well done,  
\[then\] uttered this verse \[about me\]: (2) \[1967\]  
“Because of this plastering work,  
and \[his\] intention[^4] and resolve,  
after enjoying happiness,  
he’ll make an end to suffering.” (3) \[1968\]  
\[My\] complexion \[shows my\] pleasure;  
I’m tranquil and well-self-controlled.  
I am bearing my last body  
in the Buddha’s[^5] dispensation. (4) \[1969\]  
When the hundredth aeon ago  
and no less had been completed,  
I was[^6] named King Sabbagghana,[^7]  
a wheel-turner with great power. (5) \[1970\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1971\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Anulepadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Anulepadāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Plastering-Donor.” I follow BJTS, cty, PTS alt, in reading the
    name as such. PTS gives Anulomadāyaka, “Suitable Donor”.  
[^2]: that is, the railing around the Bodhi Tree.  
[^3]: lit., “in the monks’ Assembly”  
[^4]: reading *cetanā°* (BJTS, PTS alt) for *cetasā* (“by heart,” “with
    the mind,” PTS)  
[^5]: lit., “in the Supreme Buddha’s"  
[^6]: reading *āsiṃ* (BJTS) for *āsi* (‘there was,” PTS), though the
    text is inconsistent in the use of first or third person verbs in
    this formulaic phrase.  
[^7]: “All-Valuable-er” or “Worth it All”
