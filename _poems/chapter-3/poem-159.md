*\[159. Punnāgapupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
Plunging into a forest grove,  
I \[lived there as\] a hunter \[then\].  
Seeing a laurel[^2] tree in bloom,  
I called to mind the Best Buddha. (1) \[2038\]

Having plucked a flower \[from it,\]  
well-perfumed \[and\] scented with scents,  
having made a stupa of sand,[^3]  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha. (2) \[2039\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did that flower-*pūjā* \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2040\]

In the ninety-first aeon \[thence\]  
lived \[a ruler\], Tamonuda,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2041\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2042\]

Thus indeed Venerable Punnāgapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Punnāgapupphiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Punnāga-*Flower-er,” *punnāga* being a type of flowering tree
    (Sinhala *domba*), Alexandrian laurel.  
[^2]: *punnāga*  
[^3]: lit., “in sand”  
[^4]: = *tama* (darkness) plus *ūna-da* (less, reduced)?
