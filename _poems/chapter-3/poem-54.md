*\[54. Gandhodaka*[^1]*\]*  
There was a Bodhi Tree festival  
for Padumuttara Buddha.  
Taking a decorated pot,  
I donated scented water. (1) \[1282\]

When that Bodhi was being bathed  
a huge cloud rained down \[upon it\].  
And there was a deafening sound[^2]  
when the lightening \[bolts\] burst forth \[there\]. (2) \[1283\]

Due to the force of that lightening  
I passed away \[right then and\] there.  
Standing in the world of the gods  
I uttered these verses \[aloud\]: (3) \[1284\]

“O! the Buddha! O! the Teaching!  
O! our Teacher’s \[great\] achievement!  
My dead body has fallen down  
\[and\] I \[now\] delight in heaven! (4) \[1285\]

My residence is \[very\] tall,  
rising up one hundred stories.  
A hundred thousand virgins \[now\]  
are around me all of the time. (5) \[1286\]

Disease does not exist for me;  
grief \[too\] does not exist for me;  
I do not experience pain:  
that is the fruit of good karma.” (6) \[1287\]

Twenty eight hundred aeons thence  
I[^3] was \[named\] King Saṃvasita,  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (7) \[1288\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[1289\]

Thus indeed Venerable Gandhodakiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Gandhodaka Thera is finished.
