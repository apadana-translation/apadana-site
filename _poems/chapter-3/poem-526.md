*\[523. {526.}*[^1] *Daṇḍadāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
Plunged into the forest, the woods,  
I cut down \[some\] bamboo back then.  
Having taken a walking stick,[^3]  
I gave it to the Assembly.[^4] (1) \[5573\]

Due to the pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
honored with, “happiness to you!,”  
having given that walking stick,  
I departed, facing the north. (2) \[5574\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[the monks\] that stick back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving a stick. (3) \[5575\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5576\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5577\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5578\]

Thus indeed Venerable Daṇḍadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Daṇḍadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Stick Donor.” This same *apadāna* (save for the elision of the
    first two verses of the standard three-verse concluding refrain,
    which are included here) is presented above, with the same title, as
    \#352 {355}

[^3]: *ālambana* or *ālamba,* lit., “hang onto,” is anything to hang
    onto or which provides support. I understand it as a cane for
    walking, a typical accoutrement of peripatetic Buddhist monks.

[^4]: *saṅghassa*, i.e., the Assembly of monks
