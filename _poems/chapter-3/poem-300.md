*\[300. Anusaŋsāvaka*[^1]*\]*  
I saw Vipassi, the Victor,  
wandering about for alms food.  
I gave an owl’s \[measure of\] food[^2]  
to the Best Biped, Neutral One. (1) \[2713\]  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I greeted \[Buddha\] at that time.  
I sang the praises of Buddha,  
wishing for the ultimate goal. (2) \[2714\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I sang \[the Buddha’s\] praises \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of singing praises. (3) \[2715\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2716\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Anusaŋsāvaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Anusaŋsāvaka Thera is finished.  
The Summary:  
Citaka and Pārichatta,  
Sadda, Gosīsasanthara,  
Pada, Padesa, Saraṇa,  
Amba and Saŋsāvaka too:  
there are forty-seven verses  
which are counted by those who know.  
The Citakapūjaka Chapter, the Thirtieth  
Then there is the Summary of Chapters:  
Kaṇṇikāra, Hatthidada,  
Ālamban’, Udakāsana,  
Tuvara and Thomana too,  
Ukkhepa, Sīsupadhāna,  
Paṇṇada and Citapūji:  
in total all the verses here  
\[do number\] four \[times\] one hundred  
plus one more than fifty as well.[^3]  
Twenty-five hundred \[verses\] all  
\[plus\] seventy-two more than that:  
three hundred *apadāna* \[poems\]  
are counted by those who see truth.  
The Third Hundred[^4] is finished.  
[^1]: “Praiser” or more loosely “Singer of Praises”  
[^2]: BJTS Sinhala gloss takes *uluṅkabhikkhaṃ* to mean a small amount
    and I follow suit; cf. “eat like a bird.” But the term -- which I do
    not find documented in the dictionaries -- could also refer to
    something that owls typically eat, or even the flesh of owls. Cty
    provides no explanation.  
[^3]: reading *cattāri ca satānîha* with BJTS for PTS *cattārīsa
    satānîha* (“forty hundred”); I take the total to be 451 for this
    century of legends  
[^4]: *sataka* is a common structure in Sanskrit and Pāli poetry,
    usually referring to one hundred verses, rather than (as here) one
    hundred stories.
