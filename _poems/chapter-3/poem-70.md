*\[70. Pupphacaṅgoṭiya*[^1]*\]*  
Like a lion with fearless form,  
like a great harpy with \[strong\] wings,  
like a superb bull of tigers,  
and like a high-born lion\[-king\], (1) \[1416\]

Sikhi, Refuge of the Three Worlds,  
the Desireless One, Unconquered,  
the Best Among the Monks sat \[there\],  
Honored by the monks’ Assembly. (2) \[1417\]

Having placed into a casket  
a superb *anoja*[^2] flower,  
sprinkling \[it\] on the Best Buddha[^3]  
\[I also gave him that\] casket. (3) \[1418\]

Due to that pleasure in \[my\] heart  
for the Biped-Lord, Bull of Men,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state  
beyond \[all\] conquest and defeat. (4) \[1419\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (5) \[1420\]

Throughout the thirtieth aeon \[hence\]  
there were five wheel-turning monarchs.  
\[They all were\] named Devabhūti,[^4]  
possessors of the seven gems. (6) \[1421\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1422\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pupphacaṅgoṭiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pupphacaṅgoṭiya Thera is finished.  
The Summary:  
Sakacitta, Addhāpupphī,  
and with Paccābhigamana,  
Parappasādī, Bhisada,  
Sucintī, Vatthadāyaka,  
Ambadāyī and Sumana  
and also Puppacaṅgoṭika  
seventy-one verses counted,  
were uttered by \[these\] goal-seers.  
The Sakacittaniya[^5] Chapter, the Seventh,  
[^1]: “Flower-Casket-er”  
[^2]: PSI: *Anoja* is a kind of tree which bears yellow-colored flowers.
    RD: a tree or shrub that bears red flowers, unsed in wreaths etc.
    BJTS reads *aneja* in this verse (a typo; *anojaṃ* in \[1418\]) and
    glosses *kaṭukaraṇḍu* = “a plant, Barberia prionitis (*Acanth.*)”  
[^3]: though I have translated the string of epithets in the first two
    verses as though they were nominatives, in fact they are all in the
    accusative case to agree with “Best Buddha”. Thus literally the
    translation should read, “After placing it in a casket, I sprinkled
    a superb *anoja* flower on the Best Buddha who was like a lion with
    fearless form...Honored by the Assembly of monks.”  
[^4]: “Produced by Gods” or”Abundant Kings”  
[^5]: PTS spells the name Sakacittiya here; BJTS has it right.
