*\[{555.}*[^1] *Vajjīputta*[^2]*\]*

The Blessed One, Thousand-Rayed One,[^3]

the Self-Become, Unconquered One,

rising up from \[his\] solitude,

went forth in order to seek food. \[6379\]

\[Holding\] fruit in \[my\] hand, I saw

the Bull of Men who had approached.

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,

I gave \[him\] fruit with stems attached. \[6380\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I gave \[him\] that fruit \[at that time\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of giving fruit. \[6381\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. \[6382\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6383\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6384\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vajjīputta Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Vajjīputta Thera, the fifth.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: a historical monk, “Son of the Vajjian \[King\],” who was indeed
    the son of a Licchavi king (assuming he is DPPN Vajjiputta (2); see
    DPPN II: 810-811). This same *apadāna* appears above as \#501 {504},
    ascribed to a monk named Avaṭaphaliya (in parallel texts and one PTS
    alt. sp. Avaṇṭa°), meaning “Stemless Fruit Giver”. The present
    version differs from \#501 {504} only in two minor ways: the opening
    epithet *sataraṃsi* (“Hundred-Rayed One”) in the latter becomes
    “Thousand-Rayed One” (*sahassaraṃsi*) here, and in the final line of
    v. 2 of \#501 {504} (and all the parallel texts) the fruit is
    specified to be “with stems removed” (*avaṇṭa*) whereas here the
    fruit is specified to be “with stems attached” (*savaṇṭaṃ).* With
    similarly minor variations, parallel texts are found as \#378 {381}
    as \#463 {466}.

[^3]: *sahassaraṃsi,* i.e., “the Sun”
