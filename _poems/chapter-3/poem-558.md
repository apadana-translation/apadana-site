### \[{558.}[^1] Bhaddajī[^2]\]

I, having plunged into a pond,  
served by various elephants,  
am pulling up lotus root there,  
because \[they’re what\] I’m eating then. \[6428\]

The Buddha[^3] in that period  
bore the name Padumuttara.  
Wearing cloth \[dyed\] red,[^4] the Buddha  
is traveling[^5] through the sky \[there\],  
shaking \[his\] robes made out of rags.  
Then I heard the sound \[of his robes\],  
\[and\] looking[^6] upward \[at the sky,\]  
I saw the Leader of the World. \[6429-6430\]

Remaining in that very place,  
I invited the World-Leader:  
“Honey is flowing from the roots  
\[and\] milk \[and\] oil[^7] \[flow\] from the stems;  
let the Buddha, the Eyeful One,  
with pity accept \[some\] from me.” \[6431\]

Then the Teacher, Compassionate,  
the Greatly Famed One, descended.  
The Eyeful One, with pity then,  
accepted \[that\] alms food of mine.  
Accepting \[it\], the Sambuddha  
expressed \[his\] thanks to me \[like this\]: \[6432\]

“Be happy, O merit-filled one;  
let your rebirth be accomplished.  
Due to this gift of lotus root,  
may you receive huge happiness.” \[6433\]

Having said that, the Sambuddha,  
the one whose name was “Best Lotus,”  
the Sambuddha, taking \[that\] food,  
the Victor flew off[^8] through the sky. \[6434\]

Having taken \[more\] lotus root,  
I came \[back\] to my hermitage.  
Hanging that root up in a tree,  
I remembered my offering. \[6435\]

A massive wind\[-storm\] then arose;  
it agitated[^9] the forest.  
The space was filled up with the noise  
of thunderbolts bursting forth \[there\]. \[6436\]

Then lightening falling \[from the sky,\]  
struck[^10] \[me right\] on \[top of\] my head.  
\[Because of that,\] sitting down,  
I passed away \[right\] on the spot. \[6437\]

\[Then\] bound up with my good[^11] karma,  
I was reborn in Tusitā.  
\[When\] my \[human\] body fell down,  
I delighted in the gods’ world. \[6438\]

Eighty-six thousand women \[then,\]  
decked out \[in fine clothes and jewelry,\]  
wait on me evening and morning:  
the fruit of giving lotus root. \[6439\]

Having come to a human womb,  
I am then happy all the time.  
I have no lack of possessions:  
the fruit of giving lotus root. \[6440\]

Having \[then\] been pitied by him,  
the God of Gods, the Neutral One,  
all defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. \[6441\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave that alms food back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of giving lotus root. \[6442\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. \[6443\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6444\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6445\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bhaddajī Thera spoke these verses.
