*Udakāsanadāyi Chapter, the Twenty-Fourth*  
*\[231. Udakāsanadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
Coming out from the ashram gate  
I spread out a plank \[for sitting\],  
and I served water in order  
to obtain the ultimate goal. (1) \[2424\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of seats and water. (2) \[2425\]

In the fifteenth aeon ago  
\[lived a man\] called Abhisāma,[^2]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2426\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2427\]

Thus indeed Venerable Udakāsanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Udakāsanadāyaka Thera is finished.
