### \[142. Thambāropaka[^1]\]

When the World’s Lord reached nirvana,  
Dhammadassi, the Bull of Men,  
I placed a pillar with banners  
at the Best Buddha’s stupa \[then\]. (1) \[1945\]

After constructing a stairway  
I climbed up that best stupa \[there\].  
Taking a \[white\] jasmine flower  
I placed \[it\] on that pillar \[then\]. (2) \[1946\]

O! the Buddha! O! the Teaching!  
O! our Teacher’s \[great\] achievement!  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of stupa-*pūjā*. (3) \[1947\]

In the ninety-fourth aeon hence  
there were sixteen \[different\] monarchs  
known by the name Thūpasikha,[^2]  
wheel-turning kings with great power. (4) \[1948\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1949\]

Thus indeed Venerable Thambāropaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Thambāropaka Thera is finished.
