*\[94. Sucidāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
I was formerly a blacksmith  
in the fine city Bandhumā.  
I gave the gift of a needle  
to Vipassi, the Sage so Great. (1) \[1571\]

Due to such karma \[my\] knowledge  
is \[now\] just like a top diamond.  
I have no lust, I’m fully free;  
I have attained arahantship.[^2] (2) \[1572\]

With knowledge I learn everything  
about all past existences  
and present ones and future ones:  
that is the fruit of needle-gifts. (3) \[1573\]

In the ninety-first aeon thence  
lived seven Vajirasamas,[^3]  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (4) \[1574\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1575\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sucidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sucidāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Needle-Donor”  
[^2]: lit., “the destruction of all outflows”  
[^3]: “Same as a DIamond” (or “Same as a Thunderbolt”)
