*\[37. Lasuṇadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
I was an ascetic back then  
not far from the Himalayas.  
I sustained myself on garlic;  
garlic was \[then\] my \[only\] food. (1) \[1091\]  
After filling \[some\] *khāriya*s[^2]  
I went to a monastery.  
I gave the Assembly garlic,  
happy, \[and\] with a happy heart. (2) \[1092\]  
Giving the Assembly garlic,  
intent on the dispensation  
of Vipassi, the Top Person,  
I \[then\] delighted in heaven. (3) \[1093\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[them\] that garlic back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of cloves of garlic. (4) \[1094\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1095\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Lasuṇadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Lasuṇadāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Garlic-Giver”  
[^2]: a type of container? Cty treats it as a container used by
    ascetics. Also a measure, = 16 *drona*s. Cf. above v. \[198\] and n.
