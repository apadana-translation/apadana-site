*\[280. Taraṇiya*[^1]*\]*  
On a rough spot on the highway,  
I caused a bridge to be fashioned  
for the sake of the world’s crossing,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands. (1) \[2619\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
that bridge got constructed by me,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving a bridge. (2) \[2620\]  
In the fifty-fifth aeon hence  
there was one \[man\], Samogadha,[^2]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2621\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2622\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Taraṇiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Taraṇiya Thera is finished.  
The summary:  
Sovaṇṇa and Tilamuṭṭhi,  
Caṅkot’,[^3] Abbhañjam, Añjali,  
Potthaka, Citaka, Māla,  
Ekapuṇḍari, Setuna:  
when the verses are counted by  
wise people there are forty-two.  
The Suvaṇṇabimbohana Chapter, the Twenty-Eighth  
[^1]: “Cross-Over-er,” “Ferryman.” The name appears as *Setuna*,
    “Bridge-er,” in the chapter summary below.  
[^2]: “Fully Immersed”  
[^3]: probably a typographical error; BJTS reads *Caṅgot’*
