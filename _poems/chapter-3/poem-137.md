### \[137. Atthasandassaka[^1]\]

Sitting in a large, peaked building,[^2]  
I saw the Leader of the World,  
Undefiled, Possessing Power,  
Honored by the Monks’ Assembly. (1) \[1915\]

“Who is not pleased after seeing  
a lakh with the three-fold knowledge,  
special knowledges,[^3] superpowers,  
\[all\] surrounding the Sambuddha? (2) \[1916\]

Who is not pleased after seeing  
Sambuddha with boundless knowledge,  
to whom none comes close in knowledge  
\[in this world\] with its gods and men? (3) \[1917\]

Who is not pleased after seeing  
\[him,\] the Whole One,[^4] the Mine of Gems,  
explaining[^5] the *Dhamma*-body  
\[which no one\] can ever injure?” (4) \[1918\]

Nārada Saraga<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chiya  
by \[saying\] these three verses \[then\]  
praised[^6] \[Buddha\] Padumuttara,  
the Unconquered, the Sambuddha. (5) \[1919\]

Due to that pleasure in \[my\] heart  
and \[my\] praising of the Buddha,  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth. (6) \[1920\]

In the thirtieth aeon \[hence\]  
the Kṣatriyan named Sukhitta[^7]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (7) \[1921\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[1922\]

Thus indeed Venerable Atthasandassaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Atthasandassaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Instructor of the Meaning”

[^2]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss takes this as a flowering garden or grove, but I don’t find that usage of *māḷa* with the retroflex “l,” and cty gives no warrant for such a reading.

[^3]: lit., “six special knowledges” (see Glossary).

[^4]: *kevala* is a technical term for attainers of the supreme Jain goal, especially Jinas. Here it may be read as an adjective attached to “mine of gems,” but I suspect the polemical context would have been in the mind of the *Apadāna* compilers so I translate it as a separate epithet. Indeed, many of the epithets used of the Buddha (including “Buddha” itself, but also Great Hero, Great Sage, Victor \[= Jina\], etc.) were also used of the Jina, such that in ancient India one would have had to specify *which* Buddha or Jina was being referred to.

[^5]: reading *dīpentaṃ* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) for *dīpenti* (“they explain,” <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>)

[^6]: lit., “having praised”. The verse does not contain a finite verb, only the gerund, but the latter is clearly to be understood as the former.

[^7]: “Well-Praised”
