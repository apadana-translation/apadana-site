*\[73. Saññaka*[^1]*\]*  
I saw the Teacher’s ragged robe[^2]  
stuck up in the top of a tree.[^3]  
Pressing my hands together then  
I worshipped that robe made of rags. (1) \[1431\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of perceiving Buddha. (2) \[1432\]

In the fourth aeon \[after that\]  
the Kṣhatriyan Dumasāra[^4]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
victorious on \[all\] four sides. (3) \[1433\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[1434\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saññaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Saññaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Perceiver”  
[^2]: or, “robe of rags”. The Pamsukūla robe was typically a filthy
    shroud picked up in a cremation grounds. Cf. above, v. \[592\]

[^3]: I follow the cty and BJTS Sinhala gloss in taking *dumagge* as
    *duma + agge*. It would also be possible to take it as *du+ magge*,
    “on a bad road”. Cf. v. \[592\] above for a case comparable to the
    latter. Though I do follow it here, the cty and BJTS reading rather
    begs the question how the Buddha’s rag robes got up in the tree.  
[^4]: “Best Part of a Tree”
