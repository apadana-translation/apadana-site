### \[76. Tiṇasanthāradāyaka[^1]\]

In the Himalayan region  
there was a great lake full of life.  
It was covered with lotuses  
\[and\] was the lair of varied birds. (1) \[1444\]

I was living in that region,  
bathing and drinking in that \[lake\].  
I saw the Top Among the Monks  
traveling across the sky \[then\]. (2) \[1445\]

Discerning what I was thinking,  
the Teacher, Peerless in the World,  
having descended from the sky,  
stood on the ground \[there\] at that time. (3) \[1446\]

Taking \[some\] grass \[cut\] with a horn  
I gave \[him a mat\] to sit on.  
The Blessed One did sit down there,  
Tissa the Guide of the \[Whole\] World.[^2] (4) \[1447\]

Bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart,  
I \[then\] worshipped the World-Leader.  
Crouched over[^3] I went off \[from there\]  
thinking about the Sage so Great. (5) \[1448\]

Due to that pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I was reborn in Nimmāna.[^4]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of a mat\[-gift\]. (6) \[1449\]

I was King[^5] Migasammata[^6]  
in the second aeon \[ago\],  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (7) \[1450\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[1451\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tiṇasanthāraka[^7] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tiṇasanthāradāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Grass-Mat-Donor”

[^2]: *lokanāyakaŋ*

[^3]: taking *paṭikuṭiko* (BJTS reads *pati°*) as fr. *paṭikuṭati* “to crouch,” “to bend over” (as does apparently BJTS, glossing the term *häkiḷī* = *vakuṭu vu*). This may mean that he went off still bowing in reverence, or else that he went off on all fours.

[^4]: Nirmāṇarati is a heaven wherein, as its name implies, one delights in form.

[^5]: lit., “the kṣatriyan”

[^6]: “Same as a Wild Animal” (especially a deer, antelope, gazelle)

[^7]: PTS accepts this inconsistent reading even though one of its alts., like BJTS, give the name here as expected (Tiṇasanthāradāyaka)
