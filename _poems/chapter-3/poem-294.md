### \[294. Saddasaññaka[^1]\]

When the sun has not quite risen,  
there is \[still\] abundant brightness[^2]:  
the arising within the world  
of the Best Buddha, the Great Sage. (1) \[2687\]

I heard the sound \[of him\] there \[then,\]  
but[^3] I did not see that Victor.  
When the \[time of my\] death arrived,  
I called to mind the Buddha’s sound. (2) \[2688\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I obtained that perception then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2689\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2690\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saddasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Saddasaññaka Thera is finished.
