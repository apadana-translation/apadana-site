*Bhikkhadāyī Chapter, the Eleventh*

*\[101. Bhikkhadāyī*[^1]*\]*

\[I saw\] the golden Sambuddha,

Sacrificial Recipient,

\[who,\] gone forth from the excellent

forest, has come to nirvana. (1) \[1611\]

I gave a spoonful of begged food

to Siddhattha, the Sage so Great,

the Great Hero, the Neutral One,

the Wise One, \[he who was\] Tranquil. (2) \[1612\]

When he made many folks attain

nirvana as they followed him,

a lofty joy arose in me

about the Buddha, Sun’s Kinsman. (3) \[1613\][^2]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I gave \[him\] that alms-food back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of begged-for alms-food. (4) \[1614\]

In the eighty-seventh aeon

there were seven wheel-turning kings;

\[they were all\] named Mahāreṇu,[^3]

possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[1615\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1616\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bhikkhadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bhikkhadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^2]: I read *Padenānupadaṃ yantaṃ nibbāpente mahājanaṃ/uḷārā vitti me
    jātā Buddhe’ ādiccabandhuni* (BJTS) for *Padenānupadaŋ yanto
    nibbāpentaŋ mahājanaŋ/vitti me pāhunā tāva Buddhass’ ādiccabandhuno*
    (PTS); the grammar of the latter is muddled.

[^3]: “Much Pollen”
