### \[365. {368.}[^1] Ekacampakapupphiya[^2]\]

The Sambuddha named Upasanta[^3]  
was living on a mountainside.  
Carrying one *campaka* \[bloom\]  
I approached the Ultimate Man. (1) \[3206\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
taking \[it\] with both of \[my\] hands,  
I worshipped[^4] the Unconquered One,  
the Unexcelled *Pacceka*-Sage. (2) \[3207\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[3208\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3209\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekacampakapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekacampakapupphiya Thera is finished.

English names for the tree include Champak, Joy Perfume Tree, Yellow Jade Orchid Tree and Fragrant Himalayan Champaca. It was the Bodhi tree of the seventeenth Buddha of the *Buddhavaṃsa*, Atthadassi. It has highly fragrant cream to yellowish-colored blossoms.
