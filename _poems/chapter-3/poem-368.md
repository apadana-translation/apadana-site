### \[365. {368.}[^1] Eka<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampakapupphiya[^2]\]

The Sambuddha named Upasanta[^3]  
was living on a mountainside.  
Carrying one *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampaka* \[bloom\]  
I approached the Ultimate Man. (1) \[3206\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
taking \[it\] with both of \[my\] hands,  
I worshipped[^4] the Unconquered One,  
the Unexcelled *Pa<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">cc</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">chch</span>eka*-Sage. (2) \[3207\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[3208\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3209\]

Thus indeed Venerable Eka<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampakapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Eka<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampakapupphiya Thera is finished.

The *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampaka* (Sinh. *sapu*) tree is *Magnolia champaca*, formerly classified as *michelia champaca*.

It was the Bodhi tree of the seventeenth Buddha of the *Buddhavaṃsa*, Atthadassi. It has highly fragrant cream to yellowish-colored blossoms.
