### \[435. {438.}[^1] Harīṭakadāyaka[^2]\]

Myrobalan[^3] and gooseberry,[^4]  
mango, rose-apple,[^5] bahera,[^6]  
jujube,[^7] markingnut,[^8] bel[^9] —  
I’m carrying \[that\] by myself. (1) \[4689\]

Seeing a Meditator, Sage,  
Trance-Lover, on a \[mountain\] slope,  
a Great Sage \[dwelling there\] alone,  
who was tormented by disease,  
taking a myrobalan, I  
gave \[it\] to the Self-Become One.  
When the medicine was eaten,[^10]  
it allayed \[the Buddha’s\] illness. (2-3) \[4690-4691\]

With \[his\] pain eliminated,  
the Buddha \[then\] expressed \[his\] thanks:[^11]  
“Due to this gift of medicine  
and the allaying[^12] of illness,  
being divine or human, or  
born in another existence,[^13]  
may you be happy everywhere,  
and may illness not come to you.” (4-5) \[4692-4693\]

Having said this, the Sambuddha,  
the Self-Become One, the Great Sage,  
the Hero,[^14] rose into the sky,  
just like a swan-king in the air. (6) \[4694\]

From when I gave myrobalan  
to the Great Sage, the Self-Become,  
until this \[present\] birth \[of mine,\]  
illness did not arise for me. (7) \[4695\]

This is the final time for me;  
\[my\] last rebirth is proceeding.[^15]  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[4696\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] medicine back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of medicine. (9) \[4697\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (10) \[4698\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[4699\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[4700\]

Thus indeed Venerable Harīṭakadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Harīṭakadāyaka Thera is finished.
