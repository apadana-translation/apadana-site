*\[219. Sappidāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
Seated in a splendid palace,  
surrounded by harem women,[^2]  
having seen a monk who was ill  
I helped him back[^3] to his own home  
\[where\] the Great Hero had entered,  
the God of Gods, the Bull of Men.  
\[Then\] I gave clarified butter  
to \[him,\] Siddhattha, the Great Sage. (1-2) \[2362-2363\]  
Seeing him, Quieter of Fear,  
\[his\] Face and Senses[^4] Very Clear,  
having worshipped that Teacher’s feet,  
I kept very well in the past. (3) \[2364\]  
Having seen me extremely pleased,  
with sense-faculties perfected,  
the Hero[^5] flew into the sky  
just like a swan-king in the air. (4) \[2365\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that gift at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of clarified butter. (5) \[2366\]  
In the seventeenth aeon hence  
\[there lived\] one named Jutideva,[^6]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (6) \[2367\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[2368\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Sappidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sappidāyaka Thera is finished.
