*\[455. {458.}*[^1] *Jātipupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
When the Blessed One passed away,[^3]  
Padumuttara, Greatly Famed,  
putting flowers into a box,[^4]  
I offered them to the relics.[^5] (1) \[4845\]

Bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart there,  
I went to Nimmāna \[heaven\].[^6]  
Residing in[^7] the world of gods,  
I remembered \[my\] good[^8] karma. (2) \[4846\]

From the sky a rain of flowers  
is raining on me all the time.  
Transmigrating[^9] among humans,  
I was a king who had great fame. (3) \[4847\]

In that place a rain of flowers  
is raining on me every day,  
due to that flower-offering[^10]  
to the One Who Sees Everything. (4) \[4848\]

This is the final time for me;  
\[my\] last rebirth is proceeding.[^11]  
Even today, a flower-rain  
is raining on me every day. (5) \[4849\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I presented that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of relic-worship.[^12] (6) \[4850\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (7) \[4851\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[4852\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[4853\]

Thus indeed Venerable Jātipupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Jātipupphiya Thera is finished.
