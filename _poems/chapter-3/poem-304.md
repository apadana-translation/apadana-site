*\[304. Dhammasaññaka*[^1]*\]*  
There was a huge festival  
for Blessed Vipassi’s Bodhi Tree.  
The Sambuddha \[sat\] at its roots,  
the World’s Best, the Bull among Men.[^2] (1) \[2729\]  
At that moment the Blessed One,  
Honored by the Monks’ Assembly,  
was preaching the Four Noble Truths,  
uttering \[his\] majestic[^3] speech. (2) \[2730\]  
Preaching by means of summary  
and also extended discourses,  
the Sambuddha, Covers Removed,[^4]  
purified[^5] the great multitude. (3) \[2731\]  
Hearing the Teaching of Buddha,  
of the World’s Best, the Neutral One,  
having worshipped the Teacher’s feet  
I departed facing the north. (4) \[2732\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I heard that Teaching at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
fruit of perceiving the Teaching.[^6] (5) \[2733\]  
In the thirty-third aeon hence  
there was one ruler of people,  
known by the name of Sutava,[^7]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (6) \[2734\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[2735\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Dhammasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Dhammasaññaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Perceiver of the Teaching”  
[^2]: I take the BJTS vocatives here as typos  
[^3]: *vācā+āsabhim&gt;āsabhī,* a reading both PTS and BJTS accept
    despite Lilley’s n. to PTS here that the mss. *always* give the
    (mis)reading *“vācasabbam,”* “whole speech” or “all \[his\] words”  
[^4]: *vivatta-cchada,* lit., “removed covering,” perhaps He who Removes
    the Coverings or He Whose Covers are Removed or One who is Freed of
    All Coverings (see RD s.v.). The epithet is especially appropriate
    here for evoking the “open-fisted” method of the Buddha, where
    nothing is secret or for initiates only.  
[^5]: *nibbāpesi,* could also be “extinguished,” “quenched”  
[^6]: following BJTS in reading *dhamma-saññā* for PTS *dhamma-dāna,*
    “giving the Teaching.” Though the latter comes to label important
    forms of practice, here it would be odd, since the protagonist is
    the recipent rather than the agent of the Teaching.  
[^7]: “Hearer”
