### \[292. Pupphadhāraka[^1]\]

I was a bark-clothed \[ascetic\],  
wearing deer-leather outer robes.  
\[I\] had five special knowledges;[^2]  
a person who could stroke the moon. (1) \[2676\]

Seeing Vipassi, the World’s Torch,[^3]  
come to \[the same place\] as me,  
I bore the floral canopy  
\[over the head\] of the Teacher. (2) \[2677\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I bore that floral \[canopy\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of bearing \[flowers\]. (3) \[2678\]

In the eighty-seventh aeon  
hence, there was one lord of the earth  
by name Samantadharaṇa,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (4) \[2679\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2680\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pupphadhāraka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pupphadhāraka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Flower-Bearer”.

[^2]: lit., “five special knowledges had been produced.” One was still lacking, presumably the sixth and distinctively Buddhist knowledge described as certainty of one's own nirvana; the other five can be attained by non-Buddhist (in this case, brahmin) adepts.

[^3]: *lokapajjotaŋ*

[^4]: “Holding up all Sides”
