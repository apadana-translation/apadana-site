*\[400. {403.}*[^1] *Mettagu*[^2]*\]*  
In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named Asoka.[^3]  
In that place was my hermitage,  
constructed by Vissakamma.[^4] (1) \[3935\]

The Sambuddha named Sumedha,  
Chief,[^5] Compassionate One,[^6] the Sage,[^7]  
dressing himself in the morning,  
approached me \[begging\] for alms food. (2) \[3936\]

\[Seeing\] the Great Hero who’d come,[^8]  
Sumedha, Leader of the World,  
taking a good alms-bowl, I  
filled it with clarified butter.[^9] (3) \[3937\]

Giving it to[^10] the Best Buddha,  
Sumedha, Leader of the World,  
pressing both my hands together,  
I brought pleasure to \[my\] heart \[there\]. (4) \[3938\]

Because of this ghee-offering,  
\[made\] with intention and resolve,  
\[whether\] born human or divine,  
I obtain enormous comfort. (5) \[3940\]

Avoiding states of suffering,[^11]  
I transmigrate from birth to birth.  
Having resolved \[my\] heart on it,[^12]  
I’m obtaining the deathless state. (6) \[3941\]

“This gain for you is well-received,  
which is that you saw me, brahmin.  
Having arrived to look at me,  
you’re going to be an arahant. (7) \[3942\]

Be confident \[and\] have no fear,  
after finding the Great-Famed One.  
Having given \[this\] ghee to me,  
you will be freed from being born. (8) \[3943\]

Because of this ghee-offering  
and practicing with loving heart,[^13]  
for eighteen hundred aeons you  
will delight in the world of gods. (9) \[3944\]

And eighteen times you \[also\] will  
become the king of \[all\] the gods,  
\[and you will have\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (10) \[3945\]

And fifty-one times you will be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\],  
lord of the grove of rose-apples,[^14]  
victorious on \[all\] four sides.[^15] (11) \[3946\]

Unperturbed like the great ocean,  
as hard to carry as the earth,  
in just that way your possessions  
are going to be immeasurable.”[^16] (12) \[3947\]

I went forth after giving \[up\]  
six hundred million \[worth\] of gold.  
Seeking after what is wholesome,  
I \[first\] went up to Bāvarī. (13) \[3948\]

\[While\] I studied the mantras there,  
Vedic science[^17] and \[reading\] marks,  
you arose \[in the world\], Great Sage,  
destroying that bewilderment.[^18] (14) \[3949\]

Having a desire to see you,  
I came \[up to you\], O Great Sage.  
Having listened to your Teaching,  
I \[then\] attained the deathless state. (15) \[3950\]

Thirty thousand aeons \[ago\]  
I gave that ghee to the Buddha.  
In the interval[^19] I don’t know  
\[any\] begging of ghee[^20] by me. (16) \[3951\]

My intentions being discerned,  
what I wish for \[then\] arises.  
My heart discerned \[I am\] reborn,  
\[and\] I gratify everyone. (17) \[3952\]

O! the Buddha! O! the Teaching!  
O! our Teacher’s \[great\] achievement!  
After giving a bit of ghee,  
I receive immeasurably. (18) \[3953\]

The water in the great ocean,  
the extent of Mt. Meru’s slope,  
would not be[^21] one half a quarter[^22]  
of the ghee arising for me. (19) \[3954\]

The universe’s full extent,  
made into a \[gigantic\] pile  
would not be able[^23] \[to fill the\]  
space of the clothing worn by me. (20) \[3955\]

Himalaya, king of mountains,  
although it is the best mountain,  
is not \[even\] comparable  
to the perfumes anointing me. (21) \[3956\]

Clothes and perfumes and ghee and food,  
or \[everything\] that’s in the world,  
and nirvana, unconditioned:[^24]  
that is the fruit of giving ghee. (22) \[3957\]

\[My\] couch today is mindfulness,[^25]  
\[my\] pasture’s meditative states,[^26]  
\[my\] food is wisdom’s \[seven\] parts:[^27]  
that is the fruit of giving ghee. (23) \[3958\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled.[]{#BookmarkCopy1 .anchor} (24) \[3959\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (25) \[3960\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (26) \[3961\]

Thus indeed Venerable Mettagu Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Mettagu Thera is finished.
