## Kureñjiyaphaladāyaka[^1] Chapter, the Fifty-Second

### \[508. {511.}[^2] Kureñjiyaphaladāyaka[^3]\]

I was formerly a hunter,  
wandering in the woods back then.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
\[who was\] Master of Everything. (1) \[5457\]

Carrying *kureñjiya*[^4] fruit,  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha,  
the Field of Merit, the Hero,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands. (2) \[5458\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that fruit at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[5459\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5460\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5461\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5462\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kureñjiyaphaladāyaka[^5] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kureñjiyaphaladāyaka[^6] Thera is finished.

This same *apadāna* is presented above as \#497. {500.}, the only difference being the name of the fruit given, in v. 2., and hence the name of the donor.
