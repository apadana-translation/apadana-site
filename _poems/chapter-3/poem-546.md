### \[543. {546.}[^1] Kāḷudāyi[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the One with Eyes for everything,  
the Leader \[of the World,\] arose  
a hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[6187\]

The Teacher, Best among Leaders,[^3]  
Victor, Knower of Right from Wrong,[^4]  
Grateful,[^5] Mindful of Benefits,[^6]  
urges on those[^7] at the crossing.[^8] (2) \[6188\]

Home of Kindness,[^9] examining  
\[things\] with \[his\] omniscient knowledge,  
the Limitless Heap of Virtue[^10]  
is preaching \[his\] superb *Dhamma*. (3) \[6189\]

At one time he, the Great Hero,  
assembled with limitless folks,[^11]  
is preaching the honeyed *Dhamma*,  
along with the Four \[Noble\] Truths. (4) \[6190\]

Having heard the superb Teaching,  
pure in beginning, middle, end,  
there was *Dhamma*-penetration[^12]  
for one hundred thousand beings. (5) \[6191\]

At that time the earth sounded forth  
and the clouds \[began their\] growling;  
the gods, Brahmā, men \[and\] titans  
continued[^13] saying “Excellent!” (6) \[6192\]

“O! The Compassionate Teacher!  
O! Preaching of the great *Dhamma*!  
O! The Victor lifts up those sunk  
in the ocean of existence.” (7) \[6193\]

When Brahmā with the gods \[and\] men  
were thus stirred up with emotion,[^14]  
the Victor praised a follower,  
foremost of pleasers[^15] of the clans. (8) \[6194\]

I then \[lived\] in Haṃsavatī,  
born in a clan of ministers.  
Comfortable[^16] and good-looking,  
I was rich, with abundant wealth. (9) \[6195\]

Having approached Swan Hermitage,[^17]  
worshipping him, the Thus-Gone-One,  
hearing \[his\] honey\[-sweet\] *Dhamma*,  
having served[^18] the Neutral One, (10) \[6196\]

bowing down before \[his\] feet, I  
spoke these words \[to him at that time\]:  
“O Sage, he who was praised by you,  
foremost of the pleasers of clans,  
I will be like him, O Hero,  
in a Buddha’s[^19] dispensation.” (11) \[6197, 6198a-b\][^20]

Then the Great Compassionate One  
said to me as though sprinkling me  
with ambrosia,[^21] “Son, striving one,  
you’ll attain that beautiful \[place\].  
Doing a deed for the Victor,  
how could it then be without fruit? (12) \[6198c-d, 6199\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (13) \[6200\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
the one whose name is Udāyi  
will be the Teacher’s follower.” (14) \[6201\]

After hearing that I was thrilled,  
\[and\] then for as long as \[I\] lived,  
loving-hearted, I served the Guide,  
the Victor, with the requisites. (15) \[6202\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (16) \[6203\]

And now in \[my\] final rebirth,  
in lovely Kapilavastu,  
I’m born in a minister’s clan,  
with Suddhodana[^22] as \[our\] king. (17) \[6204\]

When in lovely Lumbini grove,  
Siddhartha, the Bull among Men,  
was born for the well-being and  
the happiness of every world, (18) \[6205\]

on that same day, I \[too\] was born,  
\[and\] I grew up along with him,  
beloved, friendly, \[and\] held dear,  
confident \[and\] skilled in the law. (19) \[6206\]

At the age of twenty-nine \[years,\]  
departing \[from there\] he went forth.  
Contorting \[himself\] for six years,  
he \[then\] was the Buddha, the Guide. (20) \[6207\]

Conquering Death \[and\] his army,  
casting out \[all the\] defilements,  
crossing the flood of existence,  
he \[then\] was Buddha in the world.[^23] (21) \[6208\]

Going to the \[place\] named Isi[^24]  
he instructed the group of five;[^25]  
then the Blessed One instructed  
\[folks\], going, going here \[and\] there. (22) \[6209\]

Instructing those who could be led,  
assisting \[the world\] with \[its\] gods,  
approaching Maṅgalā mountain,[^26]  
the Victor then dwelt \[in that place\]. (23) \[6210\]

Then sent by Suddhodana, the  
earth’s protector,[^27] going, seeing  
the Ten-Powered One,[^28] going forth,  
I \[too\] became an arahant. (24) \[6211\]

Then asking \[it of\] the Great Sage,  
I brought \[him back\] to Kapila.[^29]  
Then having gone \[back there\] again  
I’m bringing the great clan pleasure.[^30] (25) \[6212\]

The Victor, glad at that virtue,  
the Bull of People spoke to me.  
The Guide appointed me foremost  
among the pleasers of the clans. (26) \[6213\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (27) \[6214\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (28) \[6215\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (29) \[6216\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kāḷudāyi Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kāḷudāyi Thera is finished.

[^16]: *pāsādiko*

[^17]: *haṃsârāmam* appears to be a proper name, though it could also be taken as “the hermitage in \[my hometown\] Haṃsavatī”

[^20]: here <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> presents as two six-footed verses material that <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> presents as three four-footed ones. The <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reading seems on the mark here, as it contains the two speeches in single verses. Indeed, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinh. gloss has to take all three verses \[6197-6199\] as a single unit in order to convey the grammar correctly.
