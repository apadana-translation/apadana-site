### \[240. Vāsidāyaka[^1]\]

In the past I was a blacksmith  
in Tivarā,[^2] best of cities.  
One razor was the gift I made  
to an unconquered Lonely One. (1) \[2459\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that razor back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of a gifted razor. (2) \[2460\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2461\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vāsidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Vāsidāyaka Thera is finished.
