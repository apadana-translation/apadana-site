*\[153. Vīthisammajjaka*[^1]*\]*  
\[I saw\] the World-Chief setting out  
like the rising hundred-rayed \[sun\],  
like the \[mid-day\] yellow-rayed sun,  
like the moon[^2] on the fifteenth \[day\].[^3](1) \[2007\]

There were sixty-eight thousand \[monks\],  
who’d all destroyed the defilements,  
surrounding the Sambuddha \[then\],  
the Biped-Lord, the Bull of Men. (2) \[2008\]

After I had swept that road for  
the World-Leader, the Charioteer,  
I \[then\] raised up a banner there,  
with a mind that was very clear. (3) \[2009\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I offered that banner \[to him,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving banners. (4) \[2010\]

In the fourth aeon \[after that\]  
I was a king with great power,  
who was famous as Sudhaja[^4]  
and was endowed with every sign. (5) \[2011\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2012\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vīthisammajjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Vīthisammajjaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Road-Sweeper”  
[^2]: reading *candaṃ* (BJTS) for *tad-āhu* (“that was,” PTS)  
[^3]: the fifteenth day of the lunar month, when it is full.  
[^4]: “Good Banner.” This reading of the name follows BJTS. PTS reads
    “by the name Vissuta”.
