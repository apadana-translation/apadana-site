*\[416. {419.}*[^1] *Patthodanadāyaka*[^2]*\]*

Back then I traveled the forest,

doing regular forest work.[^3]

Taking half a pint of cooked rice,[^4]

I went to work\[ in the forest\]. (1) \[4435\]

There I saw \[him\], the Sambuddha,

the Self-Become, Unconquered One,

gone out from the forest for alms.

Having seen \[him, my\] heart was pleased. (2) \[4436\]

“I’m bound to working for others,[^5]

and no merit exists for me.

I have this half-pint of cooked rice;

I will feed \[it\] to the \[Great\] Sage.” (3) \[4437\]

Taking that half-pint of rice, I

gave it to the Self-Become One.

While I meditated \[on him\],

the Sage then consumed \[that cooked rice\]. (4) \[4438\]

Due to that karma done very well,

with intention and \[firm\] resolve,

discarding \[my\] human body,

I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (5) \[4439\]

Thirty-six times the lord of gods,

I exercised divine rule \[there\].

Thirty-three times I was a king,

a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (6) \[4440\]

There was \[also\] much local rule,

innumerable by counting.

I’m \[always\] happy and famous:

the fruit of half a pint of rice. (7) \[4441\]

Transmigrating from birth to birth,

I receive wealth without limit.

I have no lack of possessions:

the fruit of half a pint of rice. (8) \[4442\]

Possessions come to be for me,

resembling a river stream;[^6]

I cannot \[even\] measure them:

the fruit of half a pint of rice. (9) \[4443\]

\[People say,\] “Eat this,” “enjoy this,”

“lit down \[to sleep\] in this \[good\] bed.”

Due to that I’m \[always\] happy:

the fruit of half a pint of rice. (10) \[4444\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I gave \[him\] that gift at that time,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

the fruit of half a pint of rice. (11) \[4445\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (12) \[4446\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (13) \[4447\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[4448\]

Thus indeed Venerable Patthodanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Patthodanadāyaka Thera is finished.
