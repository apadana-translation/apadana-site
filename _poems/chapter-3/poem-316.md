*\[316. Āsanatthavika*[^1]*\]*  
Sikhi \[Buddha\], Supreme Stupa,  
was the Kinsman of the World then.  
I was journeying in a dark  
forest, a barren wilderness. (1) \[2793\]  
After exiting the forest,  
I saw the \[Buddha’s\] lion throne.[^2]  
Confidently pressing my hands,  
I praised the Leader of the World. (2) \[2794\]  
Throughout the entire day[^3] I praised  
the Buddha, the World’s Chief Leader.  
Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I uttered this speech at that time: (3) \[2795\]  
“Praise to you, O Well-Bred Person![^4]  
Praise to you, Ultimate Person!  
You’re the Omniscient, Great Hero,  
the World’s Best, the Bull among Men.” (4) \[2796\]  
After praising Sikhi \[like that\],  
after saluting \[his\] throne \[there\],  
led away by other concerns,[^5]  
I departed facing north. (5) \[2797\]  
In the thirty-one aeons since  
I praised the Best Debater \[then,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of singing praises. (6) \[2798\]  
In the twenty-seventh aeon  
ago were seven Atulyas,[^6]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength,  
possessors of the seven gems. (7) \[2799\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[2800\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Āsanatthavika Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Āsanatthavika Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Throne-praiser”  
[^2]: it is also possible to read “Lion Throne” (metaphorically, Seat of
    Power) as a Buddha-epithet, though given the tangibility of the
    object -- known in royal courts and religious sites throughout South
    Asia, anyway -- I am inclined to read it (as does BJTS gloss) as
    referring to an actual throne or chair (*āsana*). Cty (p. 477)
    acknowledges both possibilities without resolving the issue.
