*\[18. Raṭṭhapāla\]*  
A rare elephant, fit for kings,[^1]  
with chariot-pole tusks was given by me  
to Blessed Padumuttara,  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One. (1) \[769\]  
It included all the trappings,[^2]  
white umbrella \[and\] a mahout;  
taking the value of all that  
I had a monastery built. (2) \[770\]  
The palaces that I built \[there\]  
\[numbered\] fifty-four thousand \[then\];  
holding a massive almsgiving[^3]  
I gave it[^4] to the Sage So Great. (3) \[771\]  
The Great Sage gave thanks \[to me then\],  
the Self-Become One, Best Person,  
\[then\] he preached the path beyond death  
to all of the smiling people. (4) \[772\]  
Then Buddha, named for the lotus[^5]  
made this prophesy about me;  
seated in the monks’ Assembly  
he uttered these verses \[aloud\]: (5) \[773\]  
“I’ll relate the karmic results  
of this one[^6] who constructed \[here\]  
fifty-four thousand palaces;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (6) \[774\]  
Eighteen thousand huts with gables  
will come into being upon  
\[his\] superb heavenly mansion;  
they all will be made out of gold. (7) \[775\]  
Fifty times as the king of gods  
he will exercise divine rule.  
And fifty-eight times he will be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (8) \[776\]  
In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (9) \[777\]  
Falling down from the world of gods,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
every time he will be reborn  
in a rich clan with lots of food. (10) \[778\]  
He afterwards leaving the world,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
will be the Teacher’s follower,  
known by the name Raṭṭhapāla. (11) \[779\]  
Being one bent on exertion,  
calmed,[^7] devoid of grounds for rebirth,[^8]  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (12) \[780\]  
Rising up, having left the world,  
abandoning abundant food,  
like one for whom almsfood is phlegm  
I have no taste for any food. (13) \[781\]  
My effort bearing the burden  
brought me release from attachments.  
\[Now\] I’m bearing my last body  
in the Buddha’s[^9] dispensation. (14) \[782\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (15) \[783\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Raṭṭhapāla Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Raṭṭhapāla Thera is finished.  
[^1]: lit., “a vehicle for kings”. See note to \[666\]  
[^2]: reading *sakappaṇ*o (“with the trappings for an elephant,” BJTS,
    alt. in cty) for *sātappaṇ*o (“with a reciter of the *Artharva
    Veda*,” PTS, also cty though the latter understands the term to mean
    “decorated with the ornaments of an elephant”).  
[^3]: BJTS, cty read *mahoghaṃ*, “a great flood,” interpreting it as a
    flood of alms; PTS reads, more straightforwardly, *mahābhattaŋ*, “a
    huge almsgiving/rice”. The meaning is anyway clear: after giving an
    almsgiving, Raṭṭhapāla Thera’s rebirth precursor dedicated
    everything to the Buddha.  
[^4]: reading *niyyādesiṃ* (“dedicated,” “put into charge,” BJTS) for
    *niyyātesiŋ* (“departed, went out,” PTS, cty)  
[^5]: see above v. \[701\] and note there.  
[^6]: reading *ayam* (“this one,” BJTS) for *aham* (“I,” the reading of
    PTS which causes the editor to place the first two lines in quotes,
    to the effect, “\[the one who thought\], ’I had 54,000 palaces
    built.’”).  
[^7]: *upasanto*  
[^8]: *nirūpadhi*  
[^9]: *sammāsambuddhasāsane*, lit., “in the Supreme (or Great Perfected)
    Buddha’s dispensation”
