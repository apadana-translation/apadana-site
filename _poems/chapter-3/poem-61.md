*Sakacittaniya Chapter, the Seventh*  
*\[61. Sakacittaniya*[^1]*\]*  
Seeing a grove in the forest,  
very quiet \[and\] undisturbed,  
\[a place for\] sages’ practices  
and receipt of sacrifices, (1) \[1349\]

making a stupa of bamboo[^2]  
which was strewn with varied flowers,  
I \[then\] worshipped \[my\] creation  
as though facing the Sambuddha. (2) \[1350\]

I was king, lord of a country,  
possessor of the seven gems.  
I delighted in my karma:  
that’s the fruit of stupa-*pūjā.* (3) \[1351\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I honored \[him with\] flowers \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of stupa-*pūjā*. (4) \[1352\]

Eighty aeons ago I was  
possessor of the seven gems,  
wheel-turner Anantayasa,[^3]  
the lord of the four continents. (5) \[1353\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1354\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sakacittaniya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sakacittaniya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Thinking for Himself”

[^2]: some PTS alternatives and BJTS read *pūlinaṃ*, “sand,” but PTS agrees with the cty in reading *veḷunaṃ*, “bamboo.” so I translate accordingly.

[^3]: “Boundless Fame”
