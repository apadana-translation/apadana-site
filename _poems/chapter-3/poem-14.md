*\[14. Culla-Panthaka\]*

The Victor Padumuttara,

Sacrificial Recipient,

leaving the group \[of followers,\]

dwelt in the Himalayas then. (1) \[708\]

I too was in Himalaya,

dwelling in an ashram back then.

I went up to the World-Leader,

the Great Hero, who’d just arrived. (2) \[709\]

Taking a floral umbrella,

I went up to the Bull of Men

practicing \[his\] meditation;[^1]

I caused \[him\] no[^2] interruption. (3) \[710\]

Holding it up with both my hands

I gave the floral umbrella.

Padumuttara the Great Sage,

the Blessed One \[then\] received it. (4) \[711\]

All the gods, who were delighted,

\[then\] approached the Himalayas.

They let out their cheers of “Sādhu,”[^3]

“the Eyeful One will give \[him\] thanks.”[^4] (5) \[712\]

After saying this \[then\] those gods

approached \[him\], the Best among Men.

They were carrying in the sky

his superb lotus-umbrella. (6) \[713\]

“Hoisting a lotus-umbrella,

this ascetic gave it to me.

I shall relate details of him;

\[all of\] you listen to my words: (7) \[714\]

He will exercise divine rule

for five and twenty \[full\] aeons.

Thirty-four times he’s going to be

a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (8) \[715\]

In whichever womb he’s reborn,

\[whether\] it’s human or divine,

he’s going to carry that lotus

arrayed out in the open air. (9) \[716\]

In one hundred thousands aeons

arising in Okkāka’s clan,

the one whose name is Gotama

will be the Teacher in the world. (10) \[717\]

When Buddha’s words have been proclaimed

he will attain the human state.

In the mind-created body[^5]

he will be \[ranked as\] ultimate. (11) \[718\]

There will be a pair of brothers;

they will both be known as Pantha.

Enjoying the ultimate goal

they’ll light up the dispensation.” (12) \[719\]

I went forth into homelessness

\[but even after\] eighteen years

I’d not gained \[any\] distinction

in the Śākyan[^6] dispensation. (13) \[720\]

I was in a dumb position;

I was despised in the city.

\[Even my\] brother dismissed me:

“It’s \[now\] time for you to go home.”[^7] (14) \[721\]

Being one who was \[thus\] dismissed,

I stood there with my mind depressed,

in the monastery’s storage room,

desiring[^8] to be a true monk.[^9] (15) \[722\]

Then to that place the Teacher came

\[and\] touching my head with his hand

then taking me by \[my own\] hand

he made me come inside again.[^10] (16) \[723\]

Teacher, with compassion for me,

gave a cloth for wiping the feet.

In this way he did purify \[me\]

as I stood off to one side. (17) \[724\]

Having taken him by the hands --

he who was like a red lotus --

right there my mind was liberated

\[and\] I became an arahant. (18) \[725\]

In \[my\] mind-created bodies

I attained thorough excellence.

Knowing well all the defilements,

without defilements I \[now\] live.[]{#BookmarkCopy1 .anchor} (19)
\[726\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (20) \[727\]

Thus indeed Venerable Cullapanthaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Cullapanthaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *samādhiṃ*

[^2]: reading *antarāyam na aham akāsim* with the cty (which BJTS
    Sinhala gloss follows). lit., “I did not make an obstacle.” This
    reading seems more appropriate, even though the Pali in both PTS and
    BJTS -- and hence in some manuscripts -- is “I did make an
    obstacle”. However indecorous this would have been of
    Culla-Panthaka’s rebirth precursor, verse 4 has him giving the
    floral umbrella to the meditating Buddha without any transition to
    suggest that the meditation had ended (a transition we might expect
    from other *Apadāna* texts which specify that such-and-such
    meditator “had arisen from *samādh*i”), so it is *only* out of
    deference to the cty that I provide this translation, against my
    inclination to take the text as given and translate the final line:
    “I caused \[him\] an interruption.”

[^3]: “Excellent!”

[^4]: *anumodissati.* The verb is more properly translated “gave a
    thanksgiving \[speech\],” as *anumodana* is a somewhat formal
    acceptance of a *pūjā,* typically provided at the end of an
    alms-meal or temple festival, and entailing acknowledgement of the
    gift, praise of the giver, and commentary on the religious efficacy
    of giving. No English word entirely captures all of these senses,
    and a string of words makes the meter impossible, so albeit with
    some reluctance I translate it “give thanks”.

[^5]: cty (p. 320-321): “Created by the mind” means “produced by the
    mind, the mind in meditation; just as the mind maintains, so does
    the body take shape, making it in the mode \[conceived in\] the
    mind.”

[^6]: lit., “in the Śākyas’ Son’s”

[^7]: lit., “Go now to your own house.”

[^8]: reading *apekkhavā* (cty, BJTS, PTS alt) for *apekhavā* (PTS)

[^9]: lit., desiring the state of a *samana* (*sāmaññasmiŋ*)

[^10]: lit., “he caused me to enter the monastery”.
