### \[341. {344.}[^1] Tīṇikiṅkhaṇikapūjaka[^2]\]

Close to the Himalayan range,  
there’s a mountain, Bhūtagaṇa.[^3]  
There I saw a robe made of rags,[^4]  
stuck up in the top of a tree.[^5] (1) \[3100\]

At that time I \[then\] scattered \[there\]  
three \[lovely\] *kiṅkhaṇi*[^6] flowers.  
Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I did *pūjā* to that rag-robe. (2) \[3101\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of three flowers. (3) \[3102\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3103\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tīṇikiṅkhaṇikapūjaka[^7] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tīṇikiṅkhaṇikapūjaka[^8] Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Three *Kiṅkhaṇi* Flower-er.” BJTS reads *Tikiṅkiṇi°*

[^3]: “Group of Ghosts”

[^4]: Or, “robe of rags”. The Pamsukūla robe was typically a filthy shroud picked up in a cremation grounds. Cf. above, v. \[592\]

[^5]: I follow the cty and BJTS Sinhala gloss in taking *dumaggamhi* as *duma* + *aggamhi*. It would also be possible to take it as *du* + *maggamhi*, “on a bad road”.

[^6]: BJTS reads *kiṅkiṇi*

[^7]: BJTS reads *Tikiṅkiṇi°*

[^8]: BJTS reads *Tikiṅkiṇi°*
