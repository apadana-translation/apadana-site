*\[242. Nāgakesariya*[^1]*\]*

Gathering both ends of a bow,[^2]

I entered into the forest.

I saw a small lake gathered[^3] \[there\],

very clean[^4] and full of flowers.[^5] (1) \[2465\]

Plucking \[one\] with both of my hands

and saluting on my forehead,[^6]

I \[then\] offered \[it\] to Tissa,

the Buddha, Kinsman of the World. (2) \[2466\]

In the ninety-two aeons since

I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2467\]

In the seventy-seventh aeon,

\[I was\] named Pamokkharaṇa,[^7]

a wheel-turning king with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2468\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2469\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nāgakesariya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Nāgakesariya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Ironwood Lake-er” (?); *nāga =* elephant, cobra, ironwood tree +
    *kesara =* small lake

[^2]: lit., “Having made a bow not two-fold.” The meaning seems to be,
    “having strung a bow”. The cty. explains that he did this “for the
    sake of killing deer, etc.”

[^3]: PTS reads *osaraŋ,* BJTS and cty read *osaṭaṃ;* both terms mean
    “gathered” but it is not clear to me in what sense that term is
    used; the implication could be that many flowers were gathered
    together in that lake, or perhaps that many streams were gathered
    together to form it.

[^4]: *sabbamaṭaŋ.* BJTS reads *satapattaṃ,* “a lotus”.

[^5]: *supupphitaŋ,* lit., “well in bloom.” BJTS reads *samuṭṭhitaṃ,*
    “risen up,” and the gloss understands him to have seen a lotus
    flower which had risen up to the surface of the water in the small
    lake. Cty does not comment on the fourth foot. I have followed PTS
    here.

[^6]: lit., “doing *añjali* on my head.” He holds the flower in his
    hands, pressed together on his forehead in salutation/as a form of
    worship.

[^7]: “Released Lust” = *pamokkha* + *raṇa*
