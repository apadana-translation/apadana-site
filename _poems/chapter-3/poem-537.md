### \[534. {537.}[^1] Mahākoṭṭhika[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the Sage, Knower of Every World,  
the One who had \[Five\] Eyes, arose  
a hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[5881\][^3]  
The Admonisher,[^4] Instructor,[^5]  
Crosser-Over[^6] of all that breathe,  
Skilled at Preaching,[^7] \[he\], the Buddha,  
caused many folks to cross \[the flood\]. (2) \[5882\]

Merciful,[^8] Compassionate One,[^9]  
Well-Wisher[^10] of all that breathe, he  
established in the five precepts  
all the rivals who had arrived. (3) \[5883\]

In this way he was Unconfused[^11]  
and Very Well-Known[^12] by rivals,  
Ornamented[^13] by arahants  
who were masters \[and\] neutral ones. (4) \[5884\]

The \[body of the\] Sage So Great  
rose up fifty-eight cubits[^14] \[tall\];  
he was Valuable Like Gold,[^15]  
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. (5) \[5885\]

\[People’s\] lifespan at that time was  
\[fully\] one hundred thousand years.  
Remaining \[in the world\] so long,  
he ferried many folks across. (6) \[5886\]

I then \[lived\] in Haṃsavatī,  
brahmin master of the Vedas.  
Approaching Beings’ Best Hardwood,[^16]  
I heard the preaching of *Dhamma*. (7) \[5887\]

Then \[Buddha\] placed a follower,  
who pastured in developed thought,[^17]  
skilled in meaning and the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
a hero, in that foremost place.  
After hearing that, I was thrilled;  
then for a week I fed \[him\], the  
Best Victor,[^18] with \[his\] followers. (8-9) \[5888-5889\]

Having covered with \[new\] cloth \[robes\]  
the Wisdom-Sea[^19] with \[his\] students,  
bowing down in front of \[his\] feet,  
I aspired \[to attain\] that place. (10) \[5890\]

Afterward the World-Chief said \[this\]:  
“Look at that excellent brahmin,  
\[now\] bent down in front of my feet,  
with lotus-belly radiance.[^20] (11) \[5891\]

This one’s aspiring to the place  
of the monk of the Best Buddha.  
Through that faith, generosity,  
and \[his\] hearing of the Teaching,  
he’ll transmigrate from birth to birth,  
being happy in every place;  
very far into the future,  
he’ll receive that delightful \[place\]. (12-13) \[5892-5893\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (14) \[5894\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
the one whose name is Koṭṭhita  
will be the Teacher’s follower.” (15) \[5895\]

After hearing that I was thrilled,  
\[and\] then for as long as \[I\] lived,  
mindful, loving-hearted \[and\] wise,  
I waited on[^21] \[him\], the Victor. (16) \[5896\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (17) \[5897\]

Three hundred times \[the lord of gods,\]  
I exercised divine rule \[there\],  
and \[then\] five hundred times I was  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (18) \[5898\]

\[There was also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting.  
Through the power of that karma,  
I was happy in every place. (19) \[5899\]

I transmigrate in \[just\] two states:  
that of a god, or of a man.  
I don’t go to other rebirths:  
that’s the fruit of good practice.[^22] (20) \[5900\]

I am born in the two \[high\] clans,  
kṣatriyan and also brahmin.  
I don’t get born in lesser clans:  
that’s the fruit of good practice. (21) \[5901\]

When \[my\] last rebirth was attained  
I was a kinsman of Brahmā,[^23]  
reborn \[then\] in a brahmin clan[^24]  
in Śrāvasti, very wealthy. (22) \[5902\]

Mother was named Candavatī;  
my father Assalāyana.  
When with all intelligence the  
Buddha instructed my father,  
being pleased with[^25] the Well-Gone-One,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
Moggallāna[^26] was my teacher;  
Sāri’s child[^27] was my preceptor. (23-24) \[5903-5904\]

When my hair was being cut off,  
views were cut off \[too\], with their roots.  
\[While\] living in the saffron robes,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (25) \[5905\]

Because my thought was developed  
\[well\] in meaning and the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
the World-Chief placed me in that place.[^28] (26) \[5906\]

Questioned by Upatissa,[^29] I  
explained[^30] with no\[thing\] indistinct.  
Thus in analytical modes,  
I’m foremost in the religion.[^31] (27) \[5907\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (28) \[5908\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (29) \[5909\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (30) \[5910\]

Thus indeed Venerable Mahākoṭṭhika Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Mahākoṭṭhika Thera is finished.
