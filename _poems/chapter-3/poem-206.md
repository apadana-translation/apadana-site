*\[206. Udakadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
Seeing the Monk,[^2] who was eating,  
Extremely Bright and Undisturbed,  
bringing water in a small pot,  
I gave \[it\] to \[him,\] Siddhattha. (1) \[2294\]  
\[Now\] today I am purified;  
stainless, with \[all\] my doubt destroyed.  
Being reborn in existence,  
that fruit is reborn for me \[too\]. (2) \[2295\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] water at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving water. (3) \[2296\]  
In the sixty-first aeon \[hence\]  
there was one \[man named\] Vimala,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2297\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2298\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Udakadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Udakadāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Water Donor”  
[^2]: *samaṇaŋ*  
[^3]: “Stainless”
