*Sudhā Chapter, the Tenth*

*\[91. Sudhāpiṇḍiya*[^1]*\]*

No one can count the good karma --

even, “for this, it is that much” --

of one who performs *pūjā* for

those who are worthy of *pūjā*,

like Buddhas and \[their\] followers,

who have crossed over tears for grief

and moved beyond ties to rebirth,[^2]

reaching nirvana, fearing naught. (1-2) \[1553-1554\]

He who would exercise lordship

here over the four continents

would not be worth one sixteenth-part

of one who performs \[such\] *pūjā.* (3) \[1555\]

When Siddhattha the Top Person’s

shrine had become broken open,

I donated balls of plaster

with a mind that was very clear. (4) \[1556\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I did that \[good\] karma back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of renovation. (5) \[1557\]

In the thirtieth aeon ago

there were thirteen wheel-turning kings,

\[all\] known as Paṭisamkhāra,[^3]

possessors of the seven gems. (6) \[1558\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1559\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sudhāpiṇḍiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sudhāpiṇḍiya Thera is finished.
