### \[302. Sabbagandhiya[^1]\]

I gave a garland of flowers  
to Vipassi \[Buddha\], Great Sage,  
\[and\] I gave to the Upright One  
\[a piece of\] the finest silk cloth. (1) \[2721\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I formerly gave \[him\] that cloth,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving perfumes. (2) \[2722\]

In the fifteenth aeon ago  
\[lived\] a ruler[^2] named Sucela,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2723\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2724\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sabbagandhiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sabbagandhiya Thera is finished.
