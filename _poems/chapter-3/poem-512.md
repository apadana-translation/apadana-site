*\[509. {512.}*[^1] *Kapitthaphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
I gave a fruit \[called\] wood-apple[^3]  
to the Gold-Colored Sambuddha,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
who had entered onto the road. (1) \[5463\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that fruit at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (2) \[5464\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[5465\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[5466\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5467\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kapitthaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kapitthaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Wood-Apple Fruit Donor.” Virtually the same *apadāna* appears
    above as \#505 {508}, with the slight difference that the name of
    the fruit in v. 1 is *amora* rather than *kapittha*, and that the
    name of the donor (*Amoraphaliya*) varies accordingly.
