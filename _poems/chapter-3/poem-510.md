### \[507. {510.}[^1] Nāḷikeradāyaka[^2]\]

In the city, Bandhumatī,  
I worked in a hermitage then.[^3]  
I saw the Spotless One, Buddha,  
\[who\] was traveling through the sky. (1) \[5448\]

Having taken a coconut,  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha.  
Standing in the sky, the Calm One,  
the Great Famed One accepted \[it\]. (2) \[5449\]

With a mind that was very clear,  
having given Buddha that fruit,  
productive of delight for me,  
bringing happiness in this world,  
I then came to possess great joy  
and vast, ultimate happiness.  
A gem was truly produced for  
\[me,\] being reborn here and there.[^4] (3-4) \[5450-5451\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[the Buddha\] fruit back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (5) \[5452\]

The divine eye is purified;  
I’m skilled in meditative states.[^5]  
Special knowledges perfected:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit**. (6) \[5453\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (7) \[5454\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[5455\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[5456\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nāḷikeradāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Nāḷikeradāyaka Thera is finished.

The Summary:

Kaṇikār’,and Ekapatta,  
Kāsumārī, thus Āvaṭa,  
Pāra[^6] and Mātuluṅga \[too\],  
Ajela, also Amora,[^7]  
Tāla and thus Nāḷikera:  
the verses that are counted here  
\[number just\] one hundred verses,  
avoiding \[any\] less or more.[^8]

The Kaṇikāra Chapter, the Fifty-First[^9]

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Coconut Donor”. This same *apadāna* is presented above as \#379 {382}, and as \#464 {467}, above, with different titles reflecting the slight change of the first foot of the second verse from “coconut” to “breadfruit”

[^3]: *ārāmiko*, lit., “hermitage attendant” or “hermitage dweller”

[^4]: lit., “from where to there” (*yahiŋ tahiŋ*, PTS) or “from there to there” (*tahiṃ tahiṃ*, BJTS and PTS alt.)

[^5]: *samādhikusalo ahaŋ*

[^6]: BJTS reads *Vārañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>a*, “*Vāra*”

[^7]: BJTS read *Amodam eva*, “also Amoda”

[^8]: *ūnādhika-vivajjitaṃ*. BJTS Sinhala gloss adds an asterisked note: “here there are seen 99 verses”

[^9]: BJTS places this line before, rather than after the summary.
