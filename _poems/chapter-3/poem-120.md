*\[120. Jātipūjaka*[^1]*\]*

When Vipassi \[Buddha\] was born,

there was a vast effulgence \[there\].

The earth itself quaked \[in response\],

\[as did its\] oceans and mountains. (1) \[1758\]

They interpreted the omens:

“A Buddha is born[^2] in the world,

the Top of all living beings

who will lift up \[all\] the people.” (2) \[1759\]

Having heard \[news\] of the omens,

I performed *pūjā* for the birth.

There is no *pūjā* quite like the

*pūjā* that is done for the birth. (3) \[1760\]

Having brought \[my\] own heart pleasure,

restraining[^3] \[myself\] wholesomely,

after doing that birth-*pūjā*

I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (4) \[1761\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,

\[whether\] it’s human or divine,

I surpass all \[other\] creatures:

that is the fruit of birth-*pūjā.* (5) \[1762\]

The relics \[now\] look after me,

through the power of my \[own\] heart.

\[Others\] cannot disturb me \[now\]:

that is the fruit of birth-*pūjā.* (6) \[1763\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I performed that *pūjā* back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of birth-*pūjā.* (7) \[1764\]

In the thirtieth aeon ago,

four and thirty lords of people,

\[all\] named Supāricariya,[^4]

were wheel-turning kings with great strength. (8) \[1765\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1766\]

Thus indeed Venerable Jātipūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Jātipūjaka Thera is finished.
