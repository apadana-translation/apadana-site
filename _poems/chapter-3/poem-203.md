*\[203. Kiṅkaṇikapupphiya*[^1]*\]*

Very Valuable Like Gold,[^2]

Omniscient One, Lord of the World,

the Lord of the World, took a bath,

plunging into a water-tank. (1) \[2280\]

Cheerful, with \[my\] mind enraptured,

taking a *kiṅkhaṇi*[^3] flower,

I gave \[it\] to Vipassi \[then\]

the Biped Lord, the Neutral One. (2) \[2281\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2282\]

Seventy-seven aeons hence[^4]

there was a king, Bhīmaratha,[^5]

a wheel-turning king with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2283\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2284\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kiṅkaṇikapupphiya[^6] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kiṅkaṇikapupphiya[^7] Thera is finished.
