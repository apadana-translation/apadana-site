*\[506. {509.}*[^1] *Tālaphaliya*[^2]*\]*  
The Blessed One, Hundred-Rayed One,[^3]  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
rising up from \[his\] solitude,  
went forth in order to seek food. (1) \[5442\]  
\[Holding\] fruit in \[my\] hand, I saw  
the Bull of Men who had approached.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I gave \[him\] a palmyra fruit. (2) \[5443\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that fruit \[at that time\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[5444\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5445\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5446\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5447\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Tālaphaliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Tālaphaliya Thera is finished.

    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Palmyra-Fruit-er.” the fruit is a purple-colored, and something
    like a small coconut. When the top of cut off it contains three
    refreshing bits of fruit which are scooped out with the finger and
    eaten fresh.
