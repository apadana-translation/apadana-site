### \[510. {513.}[^1] Kosumbhaphaliya[^2]\]

I gave a margosa[^3] \[fruit\] to  
the Golden-Colored Sambuddha,  
the God of Gods, the Bull of Men,  
who had entered onto the road. (1) \[5468\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that fruit at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (2) \[5469\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[5470\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[5471\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5472\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kosumbhaphaliya[^4] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kosumbhaphaliya[^5] Thera is finished.
