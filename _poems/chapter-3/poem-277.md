### \[277. <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itakapūjaka[^1]\]

On <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andabhāgā River’s bank  
I was going with the current.  
I placed seven *māluvā*[^2] blooms  
\[and performed\] *pūjā* at a shrine.[^3] (1) \[2608\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did a *pūjā* at \[that\] shrine,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of shrine-*pūjā*. (2) \[2609\]

Seventy-seven aeons hence  
there were seven wheel-turning kings,  
\[who all were\] named Paṭijagga,[^4]  
possessors of the seven gems. (3) \[2610\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2611\]

Thus indeed Venerable <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itakapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itakapūjaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Shrine-Worshipper”

[^2]: RD explains this as a “long creeper,” which is common enough in similes to be noticed in JPTS 1907, p. 123.

[^3]: cty stipulates that he first constructed the shrine of sand, then worshipped it using the flowers in his *pūjā*.

[^4]: “Cared For” “Fostered” (or perhaps “Carers For,” “Fosterers”)
