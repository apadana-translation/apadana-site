*\[93. Aḍḍhacelaka*[^1][]{#BookmarkCopy .anchor}*\]*

I gave a half \[a piece\] of cloth

to Tissa, the Blessed One \[then\].

I was extremely miserable,

\[and\] plagued with an awful odor. (1) \[1566\]

Giving that half a cloth I thrilled

in heaven for a \[whole\] aeon.

During the aeons that remained

I completed that good karma.[^2] (2) \[1567\]

In the ninety-two aeons since

I donated that cloth back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of giving cloth. (3) \[1568\]

In the forty-ninth aeon \[hence\]

there were thirty-two lords of men,

kings who turned the wheel \[of the law\]

known as Samanta-Odanā.[^3] (4) \[1569\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1570\]

Thus indeed Venerable Aḍḍhacelaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Aḍḍhacelaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Half-Cloth-er”

[^2]: lit., “That wholesomeness \[kusala\] was finished by me”. The
    meaning is that the good effects of the deed were not exhausted by
    the aeon in heaven; in the subsequent aeons too he experienced good
    results from it.

[^3]: “Boiled Rice on All Sides.” BJTS read Samantā-c-Chadana, “Covered
    on All SIdes,” which would better fit the nature of the original
    good deed, and is perhaps to be preferred here.
