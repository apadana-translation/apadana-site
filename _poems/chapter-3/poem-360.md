### \[357. {360.}[^1] Piṇḍapātika[^2]\]

The Sambuddha was named Tissa;  
he dwelt in the forest back then.  
Coming here from Tusitā, I  
I gave alms food \[to that Buddha\]. (1) \[3176\]

I saluted the Sambuddha,  
the Greatly Famed One named Tissa.  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart,  
I \[then\] went \[back\] to Tusitā. (2) \[3177\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I gave that almsgiving back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] alms food. (3) \[3178\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3179\]

Thus indeed Venerable Piṇḍapātika Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Piṇḍapātika Thera is finished.
