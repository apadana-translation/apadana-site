*Kaṇikāra Chapter, the Fifty-First*  
*\[498. {501.}*[^1] *Tīṇikaṇikārapupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
The Sambuddha named Sumedha,  
Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks,  
Seclusion-Lover, Sambuddha,  
came up to the Himalayas. (1) \[5359\]

Plunged into the Himalayas,  
the Chief, Compassionate, the Sage,  
getting into lotus posture,[^3]  
sat down, the Ultimate Person. (2) \[5360\]

I was a sorcerer[^4] back then,  
\[one who could\] travel through the sky;  
taking my well-made trident I  
was going through the sky \[right there\]. (3) \[5361\]

Like fire \[burning\] on a mountain,  
like the moon on the fifteenth day,[^5]  
the Buddha blazed forth in the woods,  
like a regal *sal* tree in bloom. (4) \[5362\]

Coming down from atop the woods,  
the Buddha’s rays filled \[all of\] space,[^6]  
with the color of a reed-fire.[^7]  
Seeing \[that\], I pleased \[my own\] heart. (5) \[5362\]

Wandering, I saw a flower,  
a dinner-plate[^8] with divine scent.  
Carrying three \[of those\] flowers  
I offered[^9] \[them\] to the Buddha.[^10] (6) \[5363\]

Through Buddha’s majestic power,  
\[just\] then those three flowers of mine,  
stems turned upward, petals downward,  
they’re making shade for the Teacher. (7) \[5364\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (8) \[5365\]

There my well-constructed mansion  
was known \[by the name\] “Dinner-Plate.”[^11]  
It \[measured\] sixty leagues in length,  
\[and it was\] thirty leagues in width. (9) \[5366\]

A hundred thousand pinnacles,  
a mil-*kaṇḍa*[^12] cent-*bheṇḍu*[^13] \[large\],  
made of gold, covered in flags,  
appeared for me on that mansion. (10) \[5367\]

Palanquins made out of crystal,  
made of gold \[or\] made of gemstones,  
and also made out of rubies,  
go where I wish[^14] if I should wish. (11) \[5368\]

And there was an expensive bed,  
which had an assembled[^15] mattress,  
with a wool blanket[^16] on one end,  
and furnished with \[lots of\] pillows. (12) \[5369\]

Going out from the palace, I’m  
wandering in divine travels,  
going according to \[my\] wish,  
honored by the gods’ assembly. (13) \[5370\]

I stand on flowers[^17] underneath;  
a canopy is above me.  
A hundred leagues on every side  
is covered with dinner-plate \[trees\].[^18] (14) \[5371\]

\[There\] sixty thousand instruments  
wait on me evening and morning.  
They’re attending me constantly,  
by night and day they’re not lazy. (15) \[5372\]

I delight in play and pleasures;[^19]  
desiring desires, I rejoice  
due to the dances and singing,  
the percussion and speeches there. (16) \[5373\]

Eating and drinking there I’m then  
rejoicing among the thirty,[^20]  
together with troops of women  
I rejoice in \[my\] great mansion.[^21] (17) \[5374\]

And five hundred \[different\] times,  
I exercised divine rule \[there\].  
And three hundred \[different\] times,  
I was a king who turns the wheel.  
\[And I enjoyed\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (18) \[5375\][^22]  
Transmigrating from birth to birth,  
I receive many possessions.  
I have no lack of possessions:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (19) \[5376\]

I transmigrate in \[just\] two states:  
that of a god, or of a man.  
I know no other rebirth \[state\]:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (20) \[5377\]

I am born in the two \[high\] clans,  
kṣatriyan and also brahmin.  
I don’t get born in lesser clans:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (21) \[5378\]

Elephant- \[and\] horse-vehicles,  
palanquins \[and\] chariots \[too\],  
I am receiving all of that:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (22) \[5379\]

Troops of slaves \[and\] troops of slave-girls,  
and women who are all decked out,  
I am receiving all of that:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (23) \[5380\]

Silk material, woolen stuff,  
*khoma* cloth and cotton \[goods too\],  
I am receiving all of that:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (24) \[5381\]

New clothing and fruit which is fresh,  
pure[^23] food of foremost tastiness,  
I am receiving all of that:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (25) \[5382\]

\[People saying,\] “eat this, enjoy  
this, please lie down on this \[fine\] bed,”  
I am receiving all of that:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (26) \[5383\]

Everywhere I’m given honor[^24]  
\[and\] I have very lofty fame,  
always in the majority,[^25]  
my retinue has no factions.  
I’m the best of \[my\] relatives:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (27) \[5384\][^26]  
I’m not aware of[^27] cold \[nor\] heat,  
\[and\] burning fever[^28] is not known.  
Likewise there is not found in me,  
suffering of the mind \[or\] heart. (28) \[5385\]

Having been the color of gold,  
I transmigrate from birth to birth.  
I do not know a bad color:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (29) \[5386\]

Falling down from the world of gods,  
incited by \[my\] wholesome roots,  
I am reborn in Śrāvasti,[^29]  
in a wealthy \[clan\] with big halls.[^30] (30) \[5387\]

Giving up the five sense pleasures,[^31]  
I went forth into homelessness.  
Being \[only\] seven years old,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (31) \[5388\]

Knowing \[my\] virtue, the Buddha,  
the Eyeful One, \[then\] ordained \[me\].  
A young boy worthy of honor:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (32) \[5389\]

The “divine eye” is purified;  
I’m skilled in meditative states.[^32]  
Special knowledges perfected:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (33) \[5390\]

Analytical modes attained,  
skilled in the magical powers,[^33]  
perfect in special knowledges:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (34) \[5391\]

In the thirty thousand aeons  
since I worshipped[^34] the Buddha \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (35) \[5392\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (36) \[5393\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (37) \[5394\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (38) \[5395\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tīṇikaṇikārapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Tīṇikaṇikārapupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Three *Kaṇikāra* Flowers-er.” WIth minor changes noted there,
    this same *apadāna* appears below as \#{556}, ascribed to the
    historical monk Uttara.

[^11]: *kaṇikārîti ñāyati*

[^12]: here and in the following neologism I exploit the English
    exploitation of the Latin shorthand for “thousand” and “hundred” to
    keep the meter. The Pali is lit., “a thousand *kaṇḍa*s (part,
    portion, lump, a small measure), hundred *bheṇḍu* \[tall? thick?\].”
    .

[^13]: following BJTS, PTS reads *geṇḍu,* in multiple variations. At
    least in transmission, these obscure measures may not have been more
    intelligible than they are today, even if they are clues to the
    historical situation in which the original was composed.

[^14]: *yenicchakā,* following BJTS Sinhala gloss *kämäti tänaka*

[^15]: *ºvikutīº;* I take this to evoke a mattress (*tūlikāº*)
    constructed through piling up (“assembling”) of layers of grass or
    wool (see RD., s.v.)

[^16]: reading *uddalomikaº* with BJTS for PTS *uddhalomikā* (which
    means about the same thing, see RD, s.v)

[^23]: *nava,* the same adjective translated as “new” in the first foot
    and “fresh” in the second foot

[^24]: lit., “*pūjā*”

[^25]: *mahāpakkho, lit.,* “one of the great faction” “one with a
