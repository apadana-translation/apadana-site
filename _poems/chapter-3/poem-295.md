### \[295. Gosīsanikkhepa[^1]\]

I laid down golden sandalwood[^2]  
for exiting the ashram door.  
I now enjoy my own karma:  
that is the fruit of past karma. (1) \[2691\]

Thoroughbreds, those fast like the wind,  
horses from Sindh, fast vehicles:  
I am enjoying all of that:  
that is the fruit of sandalwood. (2) \[2692\]

O! my deed,[^3] an ultimate deed,  
done well in a fine arena.  
None but deeds done for the monks[^4]  
has the slightest bit of value (3) \[2693\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I laid down that sandalwood \[there\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of laying down \[wood\]. (4) \[2694\]

In the seventy-fifth aeon  
hence was a greatly powerful  
wheel-turner who had mighty strength,  
whose name was Suppatiṭṭhita.[^5] (5) \[2695\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2696\]

Thus indeed Venerable Gosīsanikkhepa Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Gosīsanikkhepa Thera is finished.
