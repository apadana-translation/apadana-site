*\[364. {367.}*[^1] *Uddālapupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
The Sambuddha named Anātha  
dwelt on the Ganges riverbank.[^3]  
Taking golden shower \[flowers,\]  
I worshipped[^4] the Unconquered One. (1) \[3203\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (2) \[3204\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3205\]

Thus indeed Venerable Uddālapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Uddālapupphiya Thera is finished.
