### \[515. {518.}[^1] Ghosasaññaka[^2]\]

I was a deer-hunter back then,  
within a grove in the forest.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
honored by the gods’ assembly.[^3] (1) \[5500\]

Explaining the Four Noble Truths,  
he was preaching the deathless state.  
I heard the honey\[-sweet\] Teaching  
of Sikhi, Kinsman of the World. (2) \[5501\]

I pleased \[my\] heart in the sound of  
the Unequaled, the Peerless One.[^4]  
After having pleased \[my\] heart there,  
I crossed existence, hard to cross. (3) \[5502\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I obtained that perception then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of perceiving sound. (4) \[5503\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[5504\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5505\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[5504 (5506)\][^5]

Thus indeed Venerable Ghosasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ghosasaññaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Sound-Perceiver”

[^3]: *devasaṅghapurakkhataŋ*

[^4]: reading *asamappaṭipuggale* with BJTS for PTS *asamappaṭipuggalaŋ* (in which case the epithet stands in apposition to “heart” or “difficult to cross”

[^5]: Here a piece of broken type make the “6” in “5506” appear as a “4”, which unfortunately seems to have affected the subsequent numbering, beginning the next *apadāna* with 5505 (actually, 5555) rather than 5507. I have stuck with the BJTS numbering despite this error, which leaves us with two verses numbers 5504 and two verses number 5505.
