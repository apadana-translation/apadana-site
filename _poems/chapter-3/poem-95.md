*\[95. Gandhamāliya*[^1]*\]*  
I made a perfumed stupa for  
\[him\], Siddhattha, the Blessed One,  
the Buddha, Top Chief of the World,  
blazing up like a fire-altar,  
bright as a blue water lily,  
as superb as a tiger bull,  
of noble birth as is a lion,  
seated, the Top of \[all\] the Monks,  
Honored by the Monks’ Assembly,  
\[and\] covered it with jasmine flowers  
appropriate for the Buddha.  
\[Then\] worshipping the Teacher’s feet  
I departed facing the north. (1-3) \[1576-78\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave that perfumed garland \[then\],  
distinguished by the fruit of doing  
what should be done for the Buddha,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (4) \[1579\][^2]  
In the thirty-ninth aeon \[hence\]  
there were sixteen \[different\] people;  
\[all\] were known as Devagandha[^3]  
\[and\] they were \[all\] wheel-turning kings. (5) \[1580\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1581\]

Thus indeed Venerable Gandhamāliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Gandhamāliya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Perfumed Garland-er.” Cf. \#332 {BJTS only}, below, which is
    virtually identical save the addition of a verse here (v. 5) and
    related corruption of v. 4.  
[^2]: BJTS agrees with PTS in presenting this as a six-footed verse  
[^3]: “Divine Perfume”
