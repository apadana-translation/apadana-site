*\[114. Ekāsaniya*[^1]*\]*

Back then I was the king of gods,

known by the name of Varuṇa.

I attended the Sambuddha,

as his vehicle of power. (1) \[1707\]

When Atthadassi, the Best Man,

Lord of the World, reached nirvana,

supplying all the *turiya*s,

I went to the best Bodhi \[tree\]. (2) \[1708\]

As though facing the Sambuddha

I attended on the best Bodhi,

with music and with dances \[too,\]

well-accompanied by cymbals.[^2] (3) \[1709\]

After having served that Bodhi

tree growing up from the earth \[there\],

having eaten, with \[my\] legs crossed,

I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (4) \[1710\]

Delighting in \[my\] own karma,

pleased in that superb Bodhi \[tree\],

due to that pleasure in \[my\] heart,

I have achieved nirvana \[now\]. (5) \[1711\]

\[And\] sixty thousand instruments[^3]

are attending me all the time

as I move on from birth to birth

among humans and also gods. (6) \[1712\]

The three fires[^4] are blown out in me;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

I am bearing my last body

in the Buddha’s[^5] dispensation. (7) \[1713\]

In the five hundredth aeon hence

there were thirty-four kṣatriyans

\[all of whom\] were named Subahū,[^6]

possessors of the seven gems. (8) \[1714\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1715\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekāsaniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekāsaniya Thera is finished.
