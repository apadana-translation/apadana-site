*\[520. {523.}*[^1] *Saraṇāgamaniya*[^2]*\]*  
We boarded a boat at that time,  
monk and I,[^3] an *ajīvaka.*  
When the boat was broken \[to bits,\]  
that Buddhist monk gave me refuge. (1) \[5556\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
he gave refuge to me \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of going for refuge. (2) \[5557\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[5558\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[5559\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5560\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saraṇāgamaniya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Saraṇāgamaniya Thera is finished.

[^2]: “Refuge-Goer,” cf. \#23, \#113, \#298; the same text is repeated verbatim (except for the elision of the first two verses of the standard three-verse concluding refrain, included here), with the same title, as \#356 {359}, above.
