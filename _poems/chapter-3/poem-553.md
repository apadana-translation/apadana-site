### \[{553.}[^1] Gayā-Kassapa[^2]\]

I was dressed in[^3] deer-leather \[then\],  
wearing a \[heavy\] shoulder-yoke.  
Carrying a *khāri* load, I  
brought jujubes[^4] to the ashram. \[6365\]

The Blessed One in that era  
was alone with nobody else.[^5]  
He then approached my hermitage,  
shining brightly all of the time. \[6366\]

Bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart,  
worshipping[^6] the Compliant One,[^7]  
taking \[them\] with both of my hands  
I gave the Buddha jujubes. \[6367\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave that fruit \[to him\] back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of giving jujubes. \[6368\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. \[6369\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6370\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6371\]

Thus indeed Venerable Gayā-Kassapa Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Gayā-Kassapa Thera, the third.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Kassapa from Gayā,” a historical monk, brother of Uruvela-Kassapa and Nadīkassapa (see v. 36-38 of Uruvela-Kassapa’s *apadāna*, \[5946\]-\[5948\], above); cf. DPPN I: 753. This same *apadāna*, with minor changes to the second foot of the first verse (where he is made to wear a shoulder-yoke \[above he is made to wear robes of bark\]) and the first foot of the second verse (which names the Buddha as Sikhi, here unnamed), appears above as \#439 {442}. There it is ascribed to a monk named Kaladāyaka, “Jujube Donor”.
