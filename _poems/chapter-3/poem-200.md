### \[200. Yūthikāpupphiya[^1]\]

The Victor Padumuttara[^2]  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
leaving the forest goes to the  
monastery, the One with Eyes. (1) \[2266\]

With both my hands \[I\] gathered up  
an unsurpassed jasmine[^3] flower.  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha,  
Loving-Hearted, the Neutral One. (2) \[2267\]

Because of that mental pleasure,  
having experienced success,  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth. (3) \[2268\]

In the fiftieth aeon hence  
there was one lord of the people  
known as Samittanandana,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (4) \[2269\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2270\]

Thus indeed Venerable Yūthikāpupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Yūthikāpupphiya Thera is finished.
