*Nāgasamāla Chapter, the Eighth*

*\[71. Nāgasamāla\]*

I paid reverence at the stupa

of Sikhi, Kinsman of the World,

\[with\] a trumpet flower[^1] that had been

thrown away on the great highway. (1) \[1423\]

In the thirty-one aeons since

I did that \[good\] karma back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of stupa-*pūjā.* (2) \[1424\]

In the fifteenth aeon \[ago\]

the Kṣatriyan named Bhūmiya

was a wheel-turner with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[1425\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[1426\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nāgasamāla Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Nāgasamāla Thera is finished.

[^1]: all the manuscripts read *a*-*pāṭali*, “no trumpet flower,” but
    the cty takes the term as *ā-pāṭali*, a trumpet flower, and I follow
    suit, though the term could be read to mean that not only had the
    flower been thrown away; it was not even such a special flower.
    *Pāṭali* is Sinh. *paḷol,* Bignonia suaveolens, sterospermum
    suaveolens (*Bignon.*), trumpet-flower tree, the Bodhi Tree of
    Vipassi Buddha. Cf. \#78, \#96, \#248, \#255, \#369{372}.
