### \[226. Aṅkolapupphiya[^1]\]

My name \[back then\] was Nārada  
\[and\] I was known as Kassapa.  
I saw the \[Buddha\] Vipassi,  
Chief of the Monks, Honored by Gods,  
the Buddha, Bearing Lesser Marks,[^2]  
Sacrificial Recipient.  
Taking an alangium bloom,  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha. (1-2) \[2401-2402\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2403\]

In the seventy-fourth aeon  
the *kṣatriyan* named Romasa,[^3]  
strong with servants and vehicles[^4]  
was dressed with garland-ornaments. (4) \[2404\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2405\]

Thus indeed Venerable Aṅkolapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Aṅkolapupphiya Thera is finished.

[^2]: *anubyañjana-dharaŋ*, lit., “bearing the secondary characteristics,” i.e., the additional minor marks of a great man.

[^3]: The meaning of this name is unclear to me, but it recurs in numerous places in our text, and only in our text. Cf. *roma*, body hair, *romaka*, feathered, *romantheti*, chews the cud. Cf. \#265 which takes place (v. 1; \[2557\]) on a mountain in the Himalayas by this name; the mountain is named elsewhere (\#517) and the name is used also of a previous Pa<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">cc</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">chch</span>ekabuddha (\#279, \#347, \#433 {436}, below), and a rebirth-precursor of other arahants, too (\#299, below, where he is a Titan); all the DPPN references to this name are *only* to *Apadāna* (one instance in ThagA i.399)
