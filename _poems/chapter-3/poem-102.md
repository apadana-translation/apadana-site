### \[102. Ñāṇasaññaka[^1]\]

\[I saw\] the golden Sambuddha,  
Bull of Men, like a thoroughbred,  
the Great Sage, like an elephant,  
a *mātaṅga*[^2] in triple rut, (1) \[1617\]

shining forth in all directions  
like the moon when it becomes full,  
the World’s Best, the Ultimate Man,  
who had gone out on the road \[then\]. (2) \[1618\]

Pleasing \[my\] heart in \[his\] knowledge  
I pressed both my hands together.  
Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I venerated Siddhattha. (3) \[1619\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of perceiving knowledge. (4) \[1620\]

Three and seventy aeons hence  
there were sixteen ultimate men,  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[1621\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1622\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ñāṇasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ñāṇasaññaka Thera is finished.
