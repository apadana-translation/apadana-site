### \[317. Saddasaññaka[^1]\]

The Great Hero, Beautiful One,[^2]  
preaching the path to deathlessness,  
was dwelling in a superb house,  
surrounded by his followers. (1) \[2801\]

He slew the people’s attachments  
by means of his honey-sweet words.  
There was a huge uproar \[just then\],  
wishes of good for gods and men.[^3] (2) \[2802\]

Having heard the utterances  
of Siddhattha \[Buddha\], Great Sage,  
\[and\] pleasing my heart in the sound,  
I worshipped the World’s Leader \[then\]. (3) \[2803\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I obtained that perception then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of perceiving Buddhas. (4) \[2804\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2805\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saddasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Saddasaññaka Thera is finished.
