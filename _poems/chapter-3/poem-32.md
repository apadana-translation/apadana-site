### \[32. Sāgata\]

Back then I was a brahmin man  
known by the name of Sobhita.  
Being honored by my students,  
I went out to the ashram \[then\]. (1) \[1019\]

Honored by the monks’ Assembly,  
\[right\] at that time the Blessed One,  
setting out from the ashram’s door,  
stood \[there\], the Ultimate Person. (2) \[1020\]

I \[then\] saw him, the Sambuddha,  
Tame One with a Tamed Retinue.  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart  
I praised the World-Leader kindly: (3) \[1021\]

“Whatever trees that there might be  
they all grow up in the \[firm\] earth.  
So too, smart beings \[all\] grow up  
in the Victor’s dispensation. (4) \[1022\]

The Caravan-Leader, O Wise One,  
you do remove[^1] many people  
from the wrong road, lifting them up  
by declaring the road \[to them\]. (5) \[1023\]

Tame One surrounded by the tamed,  
Meditator, by trance-lovers,  
by those bent on exertion \[and\]  
by peaceful ones, by neutral ones, (6) \[1024\]

adorned by[^2] \[all\] your followers  
with their virtues, you are splendid.  
Your light spreads over[^3] \[everything\]  
like the sun \[when it\] is rising.”[^4] (7) \[1025\]

Seeing the pleasure in my heart  
the Great Sage Padumuttara,  
standing in the monks’ Assembly,  
the Teacher spoke these verses \[then\]: (8) \[1026\]

“I’ll relate details of this brahmin  
who has caused joy to be produced.  
For a hundred thousand aeons  
he’ll delight in the world of gods. (9) \[1027\]

Falling from Tusitā heaven  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots  
he will renounce in the Blessed  
One, Gotama’s dispensation. (10) \[1028\]

Due to that karma done very well[^5]  
he will attain arahantship.  
He’ll be the Teacher’s follower  
known by the name of Sāgata. (11) \[1029\]

After renouncing he’ll avoid  
bad[^6] karma done with the body \[then\].  
Avoiding bad karma with words  
he’ll purify his livelihood.” (12) \[1030\]

I am \[now\] living in that way,  
skilled in the elements of power.  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
without defilements I \[now\] live. (13) \[1031\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[1032\]

This indeed Venerable Sāgata Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sāgata Thera is finished.

[^1]: reading *‘panesi* for *panesi*, and avoiding the alternate reading (and <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) *mahesi* (*mahesī*).

[^2]: reading *parisāhi* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) for *parisato* (<abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>)

[^3]: there are problems with this verse; many alternate readings in the different manuscripts and editions. I follow <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss in taking *niddhāvate* as “*paetireyi*,” “spreads out over.”

[^4]: reading *suriyodāyate* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) for *suriyo ‘bbhaghane* (“like the sun in a mass of clouds,” <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>).

[^5]: reading (with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>, <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> alternatives) *tena kammena sukatena* for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *vimbakapasuto hutvā*

[^6]: or “evil:” *pāpa°*
