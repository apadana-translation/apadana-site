### \[234. Kilañjadāyaka[^1]\]

In Tivarā, lovely city,  
I was a basket-maker[^2] then.  
The multitude took pleasure there  
in Siddhattha, Lamp of the World. (1) \[2437\]

For the sake of worshipping[^3] the  
World’s Lord, \[one\] is seeking a mat.  
\[Being asked\] I gave a mat to  
\[those\] conducting Buddha-*pūjā*. (2) \[2438\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of mat-\[giving\]. (3) \[2439\]

In the seventy-seventh aeon  
there was a king, Jutindhara,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2440\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2441\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kilañjadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kilañjadāyaka Thera is finished.
