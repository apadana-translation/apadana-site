### \[412. {415.}[^1] Nāgapallavaka[^2]\]

In the city, Bandhumatī,  
I lived in the royal garden.  
\[At that time\], near my hermitage,  
the Leader of the World sat down. (1) \[4385\]

Taking a sprout of ironwood,  
I offered it to the Buddha.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I saluted the Well-Gone-One. (2) \[4386\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I offered[^3] \[that\] sprout \[at that time\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[4387\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[4388\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4389\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4390\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nāgapallavaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Nāgapallavaka Thera is finished.
