*Sīhāsana Chapter, the Second*  
*\[11. Sīhāsanadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
When the World-Leader Siddhattha,  
the Best Biped had reached nirvana,  
his words had been spread; many folks  
had embraced \[his\] dispensation. (1) \[674\]

With a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind  
I had a lion-throne fashioned.  
Having had the lion-throne made,  
I had a foot-stool[^2] constructed. (2) \[675\]

\[And then\] I had a house built there  
\[to shield\] the lion-throne from rain.  
Due to the pleasure in my heart  
I was reborn in Tusitā. (3) \[676\]

A heavenly mansion, well-built,  
existed at that time for me.  
In length it measured twenty-four,  
in width \[another\] fourteen leagues. (4) \[677\]

Seven[^3] thousand \[lovely\] maidens  
were always waiting on me \[then\].  
There was a couch made out of gold  
well-fashioned in the mansion \[there\]. (5) \[678\]

Elephant- and horse-carriages,  
and divine carriages served \[me\].  
Palaces and also litters[^4]  
were produced according to wish. (6) \[679\]

Couches constructed out of gems  
and many other costly things  
always came into being for me;  
that’s the fruit of a lion-throne. (7) \[680\]

I am always climbing up steps  
made of gold and made of silver,  
made of crystal, made of lapis;  
that is the fruit of the foot-stool. (8) \[681\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I performed that act \[of merit\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that is the fruit of good karma. (9) \[682\]

There were three men \[all\] named Inda[^5]  
seventy-three aeons ago;  
there were three \[more\] named Sumana[^6]  
seventy-two aeons ago; (10) \[683\]

\[and\] seventy aeons ago  
there were three \[kings\] named Varuṇa;[^7]  
they were lords of four continents  
possessors of the seven gems. (11) \[684\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[685\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sīhāsanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sīhāsanadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: his name means “Donor of a Lion-throne,” the first of many monks
    (and nuns) in the *Apadāna* who, otherwise unknown,
    embody/represent/model specific pious actions rather than play a
    role in the historical dispensation of Gotama Buddha; it’s possible
    that they weren’t even real people, or in some cases, that they are
    to be identified with historical monks and nuns who seemingly
    otherwise are not represented in the collection (associations that
    are made mostly in the commentary on *Theragāthā* and *Therīgāthā,*
    partly tracked in DPPN and worthy of a more complete review)

[^2]: *pādapīṭha*

[^3]: alternates including cty and BJTS read *satam* or *sata* (“one
    hundred”) for *satta* (“seven”) in PTS; in that reading the total
    number of virgins in that heavenly mansion would have been one
    hundred thousand.

[^4]: *sivikā* = *siv geya* (dictionary), *doolā* (BJTS Sinhala gloss)

[^5]: “Lord,” = Indra, Śakra, king of the Vedic gods

[^6]: “Happy” “Good-Minded”

[^7]: the name of a Vedic god
