*\[434. {437.}*[^1] *Ambāṭaka*[^2]*\]*  
Seeing the Buddha in the woods,  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
having taken a hog-plum,[^3] I  
gave \[it\] to the Self-Become One. (1) \[4684\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave that fruit \[to him\] back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (2) \[4685\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4686\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4687\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4688\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ambāṭaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ambāṭaka Thera is finished.
