### \[420. {423.}[^1] Ekâsanadāyaka[^2]\]

In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named Kosika.  
My well-built hermitage \[is there,\]  
with well-fashioned halls made of leaves. (1) \[4497\]

My name \[back then\] was Nārada,  
\[and\] I was known as Kassapa.  
I’m living on Kosika then,  
seeking the path of purity.[^3] (2) \[4498\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the \[Great\] Master of Everything,  
Solitude-Lover, Sambuddha,  
came \[there\] in the path of the wind. (3) \[4499\]

Seeing the rays of the Great Sage,  
flying[^4] over the forest[^5] \[then\],  
I prepared a couch out of sticks,  
and spread \[my\] leather robe[^6] \[on it\]. (4) \[4500\]

After preparing \[him that\] seat,  
hands pressed together on \[my\] head,  
declaring \[my\] great state of mind,  
I spoke these words \[to him back then\]: (5) \[4501\]

“\[You are\][^7] the Surgeon,[^8] \[Great\] Hero,  
the Physician[^9] for the diseased.  
O Guide, give your healing \[to me\],  
one who’s afflicted with disease. (6) \[4502\]

O Sage, those seeking what is right[^10]  
who see you, O Best of Buddhas,  
always gain success in their goal:[^11]  
existence is shattered for them.[^12] (7) \[4503\]

There’s nothing for me to give you;  
I \[live\] eating \[only\] wild fruits.  
\[But\] I do have this seat \[to give;\]  
sit down on this couch made of sticks.” (8) \[4504\]

The Blessed One did sit down there,  
unfrightened like a lion\[-king\].  
After spending a moment \[there,\]  
he spoke these words \[to me back then\]: (9) \[4505\]

“Be confident, don’t be afraid;  
you have obtained a wishing stone.[^13]  
Everything which you have wished for  
will be fulfilled in the future. (10) \[4506\]

It is no trifle, what you’ve done,  
in the unexcelled merit-field.  
Self-lifting up is possible  
for one whose mind is \[well-\]controlled. (11) \[4507\]

Because of this gift of a seat,  
\[done\] with intention and resolve,  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
you won’t fall[^14] into suffering.[^15] (12) \[4508\]

Fifty times the lord of the gods,  
you will exercise divine rule,  
and eighty times you’ll be a king,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (13) \[4509\]

\[And there will be\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting.  
Being happy in every place,  
you’ll transmigrate in existence.” (14) \[4510\]

Having said this, the Sambuddha,  
the Leader, Ultimate Lotus,  
the Hero[^16] rose into the sky,  
just like a swan-king in the air. (15) \[4511\]

Elephant- \[and\] horse-vehicles,  
with chariots and palanquins —  
I am obtaining all of them:  
that’s the fruit of a single seat. (16) \[4512\]

Even having entered the woods,  
whenever I wish for a seat,  
discerning what I am thinking,  
a palanquin’s waiting on me. (17) \[4513\]

Being gone into the water[^17]  
whenever I wish for a seat,  
discerning what I am thinking,  
a palanquin’s waiting on me. (18) \[4514\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
a hundred thousand palanquins  
are waiting on me all the time. (19) \[4515\]

I transmigrate in \[just\] two states:  
that of a god, or of a man.  
\[When human\] I‘m born in two clans:  
the kṣatriyan or the brahmin. (20) \[4516\]

Having given a single seat  
in the unexcelled merit-field,  
taking the Teaching-palanquin,  
I’m living without defilements. (21) \[4517\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave that gift at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a single seat. (22) \[4518\]

\[My\] defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (23) \[4519\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (24) \[4520\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (25) \[4521\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekâsanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekâsanadāyaka Thera is finished.
