### \[431. {434.}[^1] Ñāṇathavika[^2]\]

I saw the Ultimate Biped,  
shining like a dinner-plate tree,[^3]  
blazing forth like a tree of lamps,  
glittering as though \[made of\] gold. (1) \[4664\]

Putting aside \[my\] water-pot,[^4]  
\[my\] robes of bark and \[my\] ewer,[^5]  
placing deer-hide on one shoulder,  
I \[then\] praised \[him,\] the Best Buddha: (2) \[4665\]

“Great Sage, shedding[^6] the knowledge-light,[^7]  
which dispels confusion-darkness  
\[produced by\] the delusion-web,  
you’re the One who has Crossed Over. (3) \[4666\]

O Unexcelled One,[^8] you lift up  
this world in its entirety;[^9]  
there is not in its whole extent[^10]  
a simile[^11] for your knowledge. (4) \[4667\]

Due to that knowledge, the Buddha[^12]  
is known as[^13] “the Omniscient One.”[^14]  
Great Hero, I’m worshipping him,  
the Unobstructed,[^15] All-Knower.”[^16] (5) \[4668\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I praised the Best of Buddhas,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of praising knowledge. (6) \[4669\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (7) \[4670\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[4671\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[4672\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ñāṇathavika Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ñāṇathavika Thera is finished.
