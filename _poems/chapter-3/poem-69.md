*\[69. Sumana*[^1]*\]*  
I was a garland-maker then,  
known by the name of Sumana.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
Sacrificial Recipient. (1) \[1410\]

Having taken, with both \[my\] hands,  
an exquisite jasmine flower,  
I paid homage to the Buddha,  
Sikhi, the Kinsman of the World. (2) \[1411\]

By means of that flower-*pūjā*,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[1412\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I presented \[him\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[1413\]

In the twenty-fifth aeon hence  
there were four men of great glory;  
\[all of them\] were wheel-turning kings,  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[1414\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1415\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sumana Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sumana Thera is finished.
