*\[351. {354.}*[^1] *Sakoṭakakoraṇḍadāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
Having seen the path[^3] stepped upon  
by[^4] Sikhi \[Buddha\], World’s Kinsman,  
placing deer-hide on one shoulder,  
I worshipped that superb[^5] footprint. (1) \[3153\]

Seeing a *koraṇḍa* in bloom,  
foot-drinker growing in the earth,[^6]  
taking a sprig with \[flowers,\] I  
worshipped[^7] the wheel on \[that\] footprint.[^8] (2) \[3154\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of footprint-*pūjā.* (3) \[3155\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3156\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sakoṭakakoraṇḍadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sakoṭakakoraṇḍadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “*Koraṇḍa-*Sprig Donor.” *Koraṇḍa* is Sinh. *kaṭukoraṇḍu,* Barberia prionitis *(Acanth.),* cf. *koraṇḍaka, kuraṇḍaka,* a shrub and its flower, J. v.473 (RD)

[^3]: or foot, or footprint (the translation of the same word preferred in the fourth foot of the verse)

[^4]: lit., “of,” genitive case

[^5]: reading *padaseṭṭhaṃ* (lit., “best footprint”) with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *padaseyyaŋ,* though it amounts to the same thing.

[^6]: the foot consists of two different words for” tree”: *dharaṇī-rūha* (“growing in the earth”) and *pādapa* (“drinking from the feet \[or roots\]”). Though awkward in English, I translate literally here rather than give the non-descriptive “tree, which was a tree”.

[^7]: lit., “did *pūjā* to”

[^8]: the wheel is one of the auspicious marks found on the footprint of the Buddha
