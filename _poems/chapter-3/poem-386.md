*\[383. {386.}*[^1] *Valliphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
All the people, come together,  
went into the forest back then.  
Searching for fruit \[growing wild there,\]  
they obtained \[such\] fruit at that time. (1) \[3308\]

I saw \[him\] there, the Sambuddha,  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I gave \[some\] *valli*[^3] fruit to him. (2) \[3309\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave \[Buddha\] that fruit back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[3310\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3311\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[3312\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[3313\]

Thus indeed Venerable Valliphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Valliphaladāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Creeper-Fruit Donor.”  
[^3]: *Valli* is a generic term for any “creeper” or “vine” (Sinh. *väl,
    liya*), so the donation was some sort of fruit (or vegetable, e.g.,
    *baṭu karavila*) that grows on a creeping vine.
