*\[253. Citapūjaka*[^1]*\]*

The Buddha known as Ānanda,

the Self-Become, Unconquered One,

passed away[^2] in \[his\] forest haunt,

in the woods, devoid of people. (1) \[2507\]

Coming here from the world of gods

\[and\] having made a pyre[^3] I then

did burn \[his\] body in that place

and I attended upon \[it\].[^4] (2) \[2508\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I did that \[good\] karma back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2509\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2510\]

Thus indeed Venerable Citapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Citapūjaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Pyre-Worshipper”. BJTS reads *Citakapūjaka,* which gets the
    proper word for pyre (*cita*) even though BJTS retains in v. 2
    \[2508\] the form *citaṃ*

[^2]: “reached nirvana”

[^3]: taking *citaŋ* as *citakaṃ*

[^4]: lit., “I made attendance upon \[it\].” *Sakkāra* *=* hospitality,
    attendance, service upon, i.e., cleaning it up, placing flowers
    there, providing it with water and food offerings, etc.
