### \[253. <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itapūjaka[^1]\]

The Buddha known as Ānanda,  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
passed away[^2] in \[his\] forest haunt,  
in the woods, devoid of people. (1) \[2507\]

Coming here from the world of gods  
\[and\] having made a pyre[^3] I then  
did burn \[his\] body in that place  
and I attended upon \[it\].[^4] (2) \[2508\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2509\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2510\]

Thus indeed Venerable <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itapūjaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Pyre-Worshipper”. BJTS reads *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itakapūjaka*. which gets the proper word for pyre (*<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ita*) even though BJTS retains in v. 2 \[2508\] the form *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>itaṃ*

[^2]: “reached nirvana”

[^3]: taking *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>itaŋ* as *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>itakaṃ*

[^4]: lit., “I made attendance upon \[it\].” *Sakkāra* = hospitality, attendance, service upon, i.e., cleaning it up, placing flowers there, providing it with water and food offerings, etc.
