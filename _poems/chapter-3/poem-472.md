*\[469. {472.}*[^1] *Maṇipūjaka*[^2]*\]*  
The Victor, Padumuttara,  
was a Master of Everything,  
Seclusion-Lover, the Sambuddha  
was flying[^3] through the sky \[back then\]. (1) \[4943\]

In the Himalayan region,  
there was a large natural lake.  
My palace was \[located\] there,  
bound up with \[my\] good[^4] karma. (2) \[4944\]

Having gone out from the palace,  
I saw the Leader of the World,  
bright like a blue water lily,[^5]  
blazing up like a fire-altar. (3) \[4945\]

\[Thinking,\] “I’ll worship[^6] the Leader,”  
\[though\] I searched[^7] I saw no flower.  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart,  
I worshipped \[him\], the Teacher, \[then\]. (4) \[4946\]

With the gem \[I had\] on my head,[^8]  
I worshipped[^9] \[him\], the World-Leader:  
“Let there be a lucky result  
of this offering[^10] of a gem.” (5) \[4947\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the Teacher, standing in the sky,  
spoke this verse \[about me then\]: (6) \[4948\]

“Let your thought have a good result;  
let you receive huge happiness.  
Because of offering[^11] this gem,  
let you experience great fame.” (7) \[4949\]

Having said this, the Blessed One,  
the one whose name was “Best Lotus,”  
the Best Buddha \[then\] flew away,[^12]  
to where \[his\] mind directed \[him\]. (8) \[4950\]

Sixty aeons the lord of gods,  
I exercised divine rule.  
And another hundred times I  
was a monarch who turns the wheel. (9) \[4951\]

When I had become a god who  
remembered \[his\] former karma,  
a gemstone comes to be for me,  
\[which functioned as\] my source of light.[^13] (10) \[4952\]

Eighty-six thousand women \[then\]  
were \[married to me as\] my wives,  
with varied clothes and jewelry  
and wearing earrings made of gems,  
with long eyelashes, lovely smiles[^14]  
and slim waists, pleasant to look at.[^15]  
\[They’re\] constantly waiting on me:  
that’s the fruit of offering gems. (11-12) \[4953-4954\]  
Well-made[^16] things to adorn \[myself\]  
are \[coming\] to me as I wish,  
made of gold and made of gemstones,  
\[and\] likewise made out of rubies. (13) \[4955\]

Delightful gabled huts and caves,  
and beds that are very costly,  
discerning what I am thinking,  
are produced according to wish. (14) \[4956\]

The gain for them is well-received  
who get to listen \[to Buddha,\]  
the Merit-Field for humankind,  
the Medicine for all that breathe. (15) \[4957\]

My karma too was \[so\] well done,  
which is that I saw the Leader.  
I am freed from \[all\] suffering;[^17]  
\[I’ve\] attained the unshaking state. (16) \[4958\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
on all sides are the seven gems;  
there is light for me all the time. (17) \[4959\]

Because of that gem-offering,[^18]  
having enjoyed \[great\] good fortune,[^19]  
the knowledge-light is seen by me;  
I’ve attained the unshaking state. (18) \[4960\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I offered[^20] that gem \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of offering gems.[^21] (19) \[4961\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (20) \[4962\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (21) \[4963\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (22) \[4964\]

Thus indeed Venerable Maṇipūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Maṇipūjaka Thera is finished.
