### \[209. Ādhāradāyaka[^1]\]

A stool was donated by me  
to Sikhi, Kinsman of the World.  
\[Then\] I was[^2] the possessor of  
all the land \[in\] this entire earth. (1) \[2309\]

My defilements are \[all\] burnt up,  
every existence is canceled.  
I \[now\] possess my last body  
in the Buddha’s[^3] dispensation. (2) \[2310\]

In the twenty-seventh aeon  
hence there existed four people  
\[all\] named Samanta<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>araṇa,[^4]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (3) \[2311\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2312\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ādhāradāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ādhāradāyaka Thera is finished.
