*\[546. {549.}*[^1] *Vanavaccha*[^2]*\]*  
In this \[present\] lucky aeon  
Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,  
known by the name of Kassapa,[^3]  
Best Debater,[^4] \[Buddha,\] arose. (1) \[6273\]

Then I, after having gone forth  
in the Buddha’s dispensation,  
wandering in the holy life[^5]  
as long as \[I\] lived, fell from there.[^6] (2) \[6274\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (3) \[6275\]

Fallen from there, in a forest,  
I was \[then born as\] a pigeon.[^7]  
A Buddhist monk[^8] \[was\] living there,  
always delighting in trances,[^9]  
loving-hearted, compassionate,  
with a face always greatly pleased,[^10]  
even-minded, a great hero,  
learned in the \[four\] boundless \[states\].[^11] (4-5) \[6276-6277\]  
In not a long time I trusted  
that follower of the Buddha,[^12]  
whose thoughts were without obstructions,  
friendly toward all living beings. (6) \[6278\]

Then whenever \[I\] approached[^13] him,  
every day he preached the *Dhamma,*  
and gave \[a little of his\] food  
to me, seated before \[his\] feet. (7) \[6279\]

After living \[like that\] back then,  
with great love for the Victor’s son,  
having died[^14] I went[^15] to heaven,  
like home \[after\] being abroad.[^16] (8) \[6280\]

Fallen from heaven I’m reborn  
as human due to good karma.  
Throwing away \[life in\] the house,  
I \[then\] went forth repeatedly.[^17] (9) \[6281\]

As monk, ascetic \[or\] brahmin,  
I was thus one who had gone forth,  
becoming a forest-dweller  
\[in\] various hundreds \[of lives\]. (10) \[6282\]

And now in \[my\] final rebirth,  
a brahmin \[named\] Vacchagotta  
in lovely Kapilavastu,  
I set forth along with \[my\] wife.[^18] (11) \[6283\]

My mother’s pregnancy craving  
\[when she was\] close to giving birth,  
resolved \[her\] to live in the woods,  
when \[I\] had come out of \[her\] womb. (12) \[6284\]

\[My\] mother then gave birth to me  
within a beautiful forest.  
As I departed from her womb,  
they swaddled me in saffron \[cloth\].[^19] (13) \[6285\]

After that Prince Siddhartha was  
born, Banner of the Śākyan Clan.[^20]  
I became his beloved friend,  
held in confidence and honored. (14) \[6286\]

When Beings’ Hardwood[^21] departed,  
renouncing \[all of his\] vast fame,  
after having gone forth as well,  
I went to the Himalayas. (15) \[6287\]

Seeing respected Kassapa,  
preacher of rigor, in the woods,[^22]  
hearing the Victor’d arisen,  
I approached the Coachman of Men.[^23] (16) \[6288\]

He \[then\] preached the *Dhamma* to me,  
with all of the meanings explained.  
Then, going forth \[under Buddha,\]  
I went to the forest again. (17) \[6289\]

Zealously living there I \[then\]  
learned[^24] the six special knowledges.  
O! I have obtained a good gain,  
being pitied by \[my\] good friend. (18) \[6290\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (19) \[6291\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (20) \[6292\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (21) \[6293\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vanavaccha Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Vanavaccha Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Forest Vaccha,” a historical monk (and one of many from the
    Vaccha clan). See DPPN II: 828  
[^3]: One BJTS alt. reads *gottena,* “by lineage”  
[^4]: *vadataŋ varo*  
[^5]: or “in celibacy”: reading *bhramacariyaṃ* with BJTS (PTS alt.
    *brahmacārī*, “being celibate”) for PTS *brahmaceraŋ*
    (“brahmā-\[\]?)  
[^6]: or “died,” “passed away”  
[^7]: or dove, *kapoto*, BJTS Sinh. gloss *paraviyak*  
[^8]: *bhikkhu*  
[^9]: *jhānarato sadā*  
[^10]: *pamuditānano.* The Pāli is unambiguous and neither edition
    provides alt. readings, but one would expect a reading involving
    *muditā* (“sympathetic joy” or “joy in the joy of others,” the third
    of the four “boundless states”) given the reference to them in the
    final foot, and given that the other three are clearly designated
    here. Perhaps “always having a greatly pleased face” is to be taken
    as indicative of being characterized by sympathetic joy
    *(*muditā*).*  
[^11]: also known as *brahmavihāras:* love, pity or compassion,
    sympathetic joy and even-mindedness or equanimity. I follow BJTS
    Sinh. gloss in understanding “boundless” (*appamaññāsu kovido*) in
    this way, and in construing v. \[6277\] as a continuation of
    \[6276\].  
[^12]: *vissattho nacirenāsiṃ tasmiṃ sugatasāvake*, lit., “I was
    trusting in \[that\] follower of the Well-Gone-One” (reading *°āsiṃ*
    with BJTS for PTS *asmiŋ*, “in that”)  
[^13]: lit., “having approached”  
[^14]: lit., “fallen from there”  
[^15]: *gato,* lit., “am gone”  
[^16]: BJTS reads *pavāsā* for PTS (and BJTS alt.) *pavāso;* accepting
    that reading, and taking it as an ablative, “after” would not
    require the square brackets  
[^17]: *bahuso.* BJTS reads *lahuso* (“quickly”). Especially given the
    following verse, I see no reason to change, and indeed prefer the
    PTS reading  
[^18]: reading *vacchagotta dvijo tassa jāyāya* for PTS *Vacchagotto ti
    Jotissa jāyāya* (“‘Vacchagotta’ with \[my\] wife \[named\] Jotissa”)  
[^19]: *kāsāyena,* or more specifically, “in a saffron \[monk’s robe\]”.
    Saffron robes (whose origin is in the turmeric-soaked shrouds of
    ancient Indian corpses) were and are used by renouncers of various
    stripes, though for Buddhist hearers the word certainly invokes (and
    means) a specifically Buddhist monk’s robe.  
[^20]: *śākyakuladdhajo*  
[^21]: reading *sattasāre hi nikkhante* (loc. abs. construction) with
    BJTS (and PTS alt , reading *°sāre hi* for *sārebhi*, sic) for PTS
    *sārehi nikkhanto* (“departed with hardwoods”)  
[^22]: lit., “in a haunt in the woods”  
[^23]: *narasrathiŋ*  
[^24]: *apassayin,* or “saw” “realized”
