### \[293. Chattadāyaka[^1]\]

My son was a renouncer then,  
wearing a saffron-colored robe.  
He had realized Buddhahood  
and nirvana, Lamp of the World. (1) \[2681\]

Finding out about \[my\] own son,  
afterwards I went \[to that place,\]  
I went to the funeral pyre  
of the Great One who’d passed away.[^2](2) \[2682\]

Pressing my hands together there,  
I worshipped the funeral pyre,  
and taking a white umbrella  
I raised \[it\] up \[there\] at that time. (3) \[2683\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I offered that \[white\] umbrella,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of giving umbrellas. (4) \[2684\]

In the twenty-fifth aeon hence  
there were seven lords of people  
whose names \[all\] were Mahārahā,[^3]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (5) \[2685\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2686\]

Thus indeed Venerable Chattadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Chattadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Umbrella Donor”

[^2]: lit., “who’d realized nirvana,” *nibbuta* here echoing the use of the term in the last line of v. 1 \[2681\].

[^3]: “Greatly Worthy,” echoing the “arahant” state subsequently achieved.
