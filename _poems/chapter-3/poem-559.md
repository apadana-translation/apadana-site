*\[{559.}*[^1] *Sīvaka*[^2]*\]*

When Vipassi, the Sage So Great,

was going about as \[he\] wished,

seeing \[that his\] bowl was empty,

I filled \[it\] with barley porridge.[^3] \[6446\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I gave that alms food at that time,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of barley porridge. \[6447\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. \[6448\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6449\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6450\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sīvaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sīvaka Thera, the ninth.

The Summary of That:

Yasa and Nadī-Kassapa,

Gayā, Kimbila, Vajjita,

two Uttaras and Bhaddaji

and Sīvaka the final one.

The Yasa Chapter, the fifty-sixth.

The *Therāpadāna* is finished.

(In the book “machasa” \[one of BJTS’ alt. editions\] the *apadānas* of
the Theras Raṭṭhapāla \[and\] Upavāna are shown, merged into the end of
the Yasa Chapter. It should be understood that they are not shown here
due to their coming in the second and third chapters of the first part
of the *Apadānapāḷi* \[Raṭṭhapāla is \#18, in the second chapter;
Upavāna is \#22, in the third chapter\].)

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Auspicious,” a historical monk, see DPPN II: 1162. This same
    *apadāna* is included above, verbatim, as \#472 {475}, Kummāsadāyaka
    (“Barley-Porridge Donor”)

[^3]: *kummāsa,* Skt. *kulmāṣa*, a preparation of barley, either as a
    soft porridge or gruel (PSI *yavayen kaḷ aharayak,”*a food made with
    barley;” BJTS Sinh. gloss *komupiṇḍu,* “soft-boiled alms”), or as an
    unleavened cake or junket (PSI: Sinh. *roṭiya*). Given the
    description of “filling” the empty bowl, the former seems more
    likely and I have translated accordingly. It is at any rate some
    food made out of barley.
