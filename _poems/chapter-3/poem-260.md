*\[260. Aggapupphiya*[^1]*\]*

To give an *aggaja*[^2] blossom,

I approached the Ultimate Man,

the Golden-Colored Sambuddha,

Sikhi, \[who\] like a heap of fire[^3]

was shining forth \[his thousand\] rays

while sitting on a mountainside.

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,

I offered Buddha \[that flower\]. (1-2) \[2535-2536\]

In the thirty-one aeons since

I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2537\]

In the twenty-fifth aeon \[hence\]

I‘m known \[by the name\] Amita,[^4]

a wheel-turning king with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2538\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2539\]

Thus indeed Venerable Aggapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Aggapupphiya Thera is finished.

The summary:

Thomaka, Bhikkha, Citaka,

Campaka, Sattapāṭali,

‘pāhana, Mañjari, Paṇṇa,

Kuṭida, Aggapupphiya[^5]

and the verses here are counted

as exactly forty plus one.

The Thomaka Chapter, the Twenty-Sixth

[^1]: “*Agga*-Flower-er”. BJTS takes *agga (*“first” or “chief”*)* or
    *aggaja* (“first born” or “eldest brother”) as the name of a flower,
    which is reasonable given the context of its usage here, and is also
    the conclusion of the cty: “*Aggajaṃ puppham ādāya* ti
    aggaja-nāmakaṃ pupphaṃ...”

[^2]: one is tempted to take the literal meaning (“first born” etc.) as
    a proper name of the flower and translate accordingly, but I have
    not found the term in dictionaries so that would imply too much
    certainly about it. The PTS ed. gives the name of the monk as
    Aggapupphiya, and it is thus unclear whether *agga* or *aggaja*
    would be the flower's name. It is also possible, contra the BJTS, to
    see this not as the *name* of the flower but rather some
    characteristic of it, e.g., “first blossom” on a plant, or “produced
    (*jan*) through some chief/top/best method (*agga*).

[^3]: *sikhī,* a play on the meaning of the Buddha’s name. It can also
    mean “peacock.”

[^4]: “Boundless”

[^5]: omitting *ca* following PTS alternative as well as BJTS. This
    keeps the meter right, in Pāli as much as in English. There are
    anyway already two *ca*s in the following line, which keeps the
    English awkward enough.
