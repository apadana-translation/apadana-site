*\[392. {395.}*[^1] *Padumakūṭāgāriya*[^2]*\]*  
Piyadassi, the Blessed One,  
the Self-Become One, World-Leader,  
Solitude-Lover, Sambuddha,  
Skilled in Meditation, was Sage. (1) \[3726\]

Entering[^3] a grove in the woods,  
Piyadassi, the Sage So Great,  
spreading out \[his\] robe made of rags,  
sat down, the Ultimate Person. (2) \[3727\]

I was a deer-hunter back then,  
within a grove in the forest.[^4]  
I was wandering around[^5] back  
then, searching for a spotted[^6] deer. (3) \[3728\]

\[Then\] I saw the Sambuddha there,  
Flood-Crosser, the Undefiled One,  
like a regal *sal* tree in bloom,  
like the risen hundred-rayed \[sun\]. (4) \[3729\]

Having seen \[him\], the God of Gods,  
Piyadassi, the Great-Famed One,  
entering a natural lake,  
I brought \[some\] lotuses back then. (5) \[3730\]

After bringing \[those\] lotuses,  
hundred-petaled \[and\] beautiful,  
having built a gabled hut, I  
\[then\] covered \[it\] with lotuses. (6) \[3731\]

Pitier, Compassionate One,  
Piyadassi, the Sage So Great,  
seven nights and days the Buddha,  
Victor, dwelt in \[that\] gabled hut. (7) \[3732\]

Throwing out the old \[lotuses,\]  
I covered it with new ones \[then\].  
I stood \[there\] for that entire time,  
hands pressed together \[in worship\]. (8) \[3733\]

RIsing up from meditation,  
Piyadassi, the Sage So Great,  
looking out in \[all\] directions  
the Leader of the World sat down. (9) \[3734\]

At that time Sudassana[^7] was  
\[Buddha’s\] powerful attendant.  
Knowing the thoughts of the Buddha,  
of Piyadassi, the Teacher,  
surrounded by \[accomplished\] monks  
\[whose number was\] eighty thousand,  
he went up to the World-Leader,  
seated happily in the woods.[^8] (10-11) \[3735-3736\]  
All the gods who were residing  
throughout \[that\] grove in the forest,  
knowing the thoughts of the Buddha,  
then assembled together \[there\]. (12) \[3737\]

When the spirits,[^9] the *kumbhaṇḍa*s  
and the demons[^10] came together,  
and the monks’ Assembly arrived,  
the Victor uttered \[these\] verses: (13) \[3738\]

“He who worshipped[^11] me for a week  
and made a residence for me,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (14) \[3739\]

I shall relate through \[my\] knowledge  
what’s very hard to point out, deep,  
very subtle and well-explained;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (15) \[3740\]

For fourteen aeons \[this one\] will  
exercise rule over the gods.  
They will carry up in the sky  
a lofty gabled hut for him,  
\[well-\]covered with lotus flowers:  
that’s the fruit of former karma. (16) \[3741\][^12]  
For twenty-four hundred[^13] aeons  
he will transmigrate here and there.[^14]  
A flying mansion[^15] made of blooms[^16]  
will be carried in the sky there. (17) \[3742\]

Just as water does not stick to  
\[the surface\] of a lotus-leaf,  
so defilements do not stick to  
\[a possessor\] of this knowledge. (18) \[3743\]

This one, after shattering[^17] the  
five obstacles[^18] with \[his own\] mind,  
giving birth to the intention,[^19]  
setting out from home he’ll renounce;  
after that the floral mansion  
will set forth \[too\], being carried. (18e-f, 19) \[3744\][^20]  
When \[he’s\] dwelling beneath a tree,  
\[or\] when his mindfulness is sharp,[^21]  
there \[that\] mansion made of flowers  
will be carried over \[his\] head. (20) \[3745\]

Having given robes and alms-food,  
requisites and dwelling places  
to the Assembly of the monks,[^22]  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (21) \[3746\]

Through actions[^23] with the gabled hut,  
I went forth to ordination;[^24]  
when \[I’m\] dwelling beneath a tree,  
the gabled hut’s carried \[for me\]. (22) \[3747\]

Intentions don’t exist in me  
\[for getting\] robes or[^25] food as alms.  
In connection with \[my\] karma,[^26]  
I get \[both\] already prepared. (23) \[3748\]

I’ve lived[^27] many million[^28] aeons,  
innumerable by counting.  
They’ve elapsed \[for me\] emptily;[^29]  
the World-Leaders have been set free.[^30] (24) \[3749\]

Eighteen hundred aeons \[ago\]  
\[lived\] the Guide named Piyadassi.  
Having served him attentively,[^31]  
I came into this \[present\] womb. (25) \[3750\]

Here[^32] I saw[^33] Sambuddha named  
Anoma,[^34] the One with \[Five\] Eyes.  
Having \[then\] gone up to him, I  
went forth into the homeless life. (26) \[3751\]

The Buddha, Ender of Dis-ease,[^35]  
the Victor preached the path to me.  
Having listened to his Teaching,  
I realized the deathless state. (27) \[3752\]

Having pleased \[him\], the Sambuddha,  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled. []{#BookmarkCopy1 .anchor}(28) \[3753\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I worshipped[^36] the Buddha \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (29) \[3754\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
All defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (30) \[3755\]

My being in Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (31) \[3756\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (32) \[3757\]

Thus indeed Venerable Padumakūṭāgāriya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Padumakūṭāgāriya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Pink Lotus Gabled-Hut-er”

[^3]: taking *samogayha* as grnd. of *samugaṇhāti*, should be
    *samuggayha,* BJTS glosses *pavisi*, “he entered,” and I follow
    suit, unclear how “seized” or “taken” would apply here.

[^4]: reading *vipine* with BJTS for PTS *iriṇe* (‘in the desert”)

[^5]: reading *āhiṇḍāmi* with BJTS for PTS *ahiṇḍāmi*, “not wandering
    about”

[^6]: *pasadaŋ = pasataŋ* (RD *pasata* 1)

[^7]: “Good to Look At.” lit., “the one named Sudassana”

[^8]: *vanante,* “within the forest”

[^9]: *yakkhesu*

[^10]: *rakkhase*

[^11]: lit., “did *pūjā”*

[^12]: PTS and BJTS agree in presenting this as a six-footed verse

[^13]: the figure should be eighteen hundred aeons, as Piyadassi is
    stated below to have lived eighteen hundred aeons ago. I don’t know
    how to make sense of this prediction of a future of twenty-four
    hundred aeons for the protagonist, since the point of the poem is
    that eighteen hundred aeons after Piyadassi he became an arahant (in
    the dispensation of Gotama Buddha). But the Pāli is clear, so I
    leave the discrepancy to stand. The protagonist does after all admit
    that the kalpas he’s lived are “innumerable by counting.”

[^14]: *vokiṇṇaŋ,* lit., “strewn about.” I follow BJTS Sinhala gloss
    (*oba moba*) in this translation

[^15]: *vyamham*

[^16]: *pupphamayaŋ*

[^17]: *vivaṭṭetvā, “*causing to be turn away,” “destroying”

[^18]: *pañcanivāraṇe.* five obstacles to arahantship. RD: “kāmacchanda,
    abhijjhā-vyāpāda, thīnamiddha, uddhacca-kukkucca, vicikicchā,” i.e.,
    attraction to sense pleasures, acting badly due to covetousness,
    sloth and torpor, flurry and worry, doubt.

[^19]: lit., “thought,” “mind,” *cittaŋ janetvā*

[^20]: PTS connects the first two feet of this verse with the previous
    one, which it (unlike BJTS) presents as six-footed, BJTS makes these
    the first two feet of the present, six-footed verse. I follow BJTS
    here.

[^21]: *nipakassa satīmato*

[^22]: *bhikkhusaṅghassa*

[^23]: *caraṇā,* BJTS *caratā*

[^24]: *pabbajjaŋ abhinikkhamiŋ*

[^25]: lit., “and,” *ca*

[^26]: lit., “with \[my\] meritorious karma”

[^27]: lit., “to me \[there have been\]”

[^28]: lit., “many ten million,” i.e., “many koṭis”

[^29]: *rittikā te atikkantā*

[^30]: reading *pamuttā* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *pavuttā.* The
    sense of the verse -- which I admit to finding cryptic -- seems to
    be, as BJTS gloss gives it, that this vast expanse of time was empty
    in the absence of Buddhas, who in achieving nirvana let go of (were
    not present in) the world.

[^31]: *tam ahaŋ payirūpāsitvā*

[^32]: reading *idhaº* with BJTS for PTS *tam*

[^33]: *addassāsiŋ,* BJTS reads *addasāsiṃ *

[^34]: read “Gotama,” as below? Or read *Anomaŋ nāma* as “certainly
    Supreme/Not Inferior” rather than “named Anoma”? The latter is
    however the BJTS gloss, and I translate accordingly.

[^35]: *dukkhass’ antakaro Buddho*

[^36]: lit., “did *pūjā*”
