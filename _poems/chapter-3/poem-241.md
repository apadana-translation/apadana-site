## Tuvaradāya Chapter, the Twenty-Fifth

### \[241. Tuvaradāyaka[^1]\]

I was a deer-hunter back then,  
within a grove in the forest.  
I brought the monks[^2] a \[vessel\] filled[^3]  
with *tuvara*[^4] \[for them to eat\].[^5] (1) \[2462\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[them\] that gift at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of *tuvara*. (2) \[2463\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2464\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tuvaradāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tuvaradāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Tuvara Donor”. *tuvara* = Sinh. *tōra*, a tree whose seed is eaten as a grain (*tōra parippu* = “*tōra* lentils” = toor dhal)

[^2]: *saṅghassa*

[^3]: reading *bharitvā* with BJTS and cty (and PTS alternative) for PTS *haritvā*

[^4]: this reading follows the BJTS gloss, and also the cty, which explains: “having filled \[it\] with a handful of *tuvara*, like a small amount of *mung*, a little bit of *tuvara*, I gave \[it\] in a vessel to the *saṅgha* which had entered/was living in the forest.” *Tuvara* (Sinh. *tōra*) is a tree whose seeds are boiled and eaten like lentils.

[^5]: lit., “I gave \[it\]”
