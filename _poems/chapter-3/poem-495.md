### \[492. {495.}[^1] Upaḍḍhadussadāyaka[^2]\]

Named Sujāta, the follower  
of Padumuttara Buddha,[^3]  
searching for a robe made of rags,  
is always[^4] going[^5] \[through\] the trash. (1) \[5279\]

In the city, Haṃsavatī,  
I was the hireling of others.  
Having given \[him\] half a cloth,  
I saluted \[him\] with my head. (2) \[5280\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (3) \[5281\]

Thirty-three times the lord of gods,  
I exercised divine rule \[there\].  
Seventy-seven times I was  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (4) \[5282\]

\[There was also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting.  
Because of giving half a cloth,  
I rejoice with nothing to fear.[^6] (5) \[5283\]

And today \[if\] I am wishing,  
\[in\] the woods or \[on\] a mountain,  
I am covered in *khoma*-cloth:  
that is the fruit of half a cloth. (6) \[5284\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave that donation then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of half a cloth. (7) \[5285\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (8) \[5286\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[5287\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[5288\]

Thus indeed Venerable Upaḍḍhadussadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Upaḍḍhadussadāyaka Thera is finished.
