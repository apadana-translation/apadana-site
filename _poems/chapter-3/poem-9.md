*\[9. Khadiravaniya Revata\]*  
The River named Bhāgīrathī[^1]  
is fed by the Himalayas.  
I, a Boatman on the near bank,  
ferried \[folks\] over the rough ford. (1) \[637\]

“The Lord \[named\] Padumuttara  
the Sambuddha, the Best Biped,  
with one hundred thousand arahants  
will \[need to\] cross the raging stream.” (2) \[638\]

Getting many boats tied as one  
very carefully by workers  
\[and\] having made a covering,  
I honored \[him\], the Bull of Men. (3) \[639\]

When the Sambuddha had arrived  
he \[then\] climbed onto that \[large\] boat.[^2]  
In the middle of the river  
the Teacher spoke these verses \[then\]: (4) \[640\]

“He who ferried the Sambuddha  
and undefiled Assembly across,  
due to the pleasure in \[his\] heart  
will delight in the world of gods. (5) \[641\]

A divine mansion will arise,  
well made for you, fixed on a boat  
which will always sail across the  
sky, with a floral canopy. (6) \[642\]

In the fifty-eighth aeon \[thence\]  
he will be a wheel-turning king,  
victorious on \[all\] four sides  
a Kṣatriyan named Tāraṇa.[^3] (7) \[643\]

In the fifty-seventh aeon  
he’ll be the king[^4] named Campaka.[^5]  
With mighty power, he will shine  
just like the sun \[when it\] rises. (8) \[644\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (9) \[645\]

Falling from the highest heaven[^6]  
he will go to a human state.  
He’ll be a kinsman of Brahma;[^7]  
he will be known as Revata. (10) \[646\]

Setting forth from the house \[and world,\]  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
he’ll renounce in the teaching of  
the Blessed One \[named\] Gotama. (11) \[647\]

And later on, once he’s renounced,  
bound to the rule, contemplative,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (12) \[648\]

My effort bearing the burden  
brought me release from attachments.  
\[Now\] I’m bearing my last body  
in the Supreme Buddha’s teaching.[^8] (13) \[649\]

Karma done a hundred thousand  
\[aeons hence\] showed me \[its\] fruit here:  
well-liberated, arrow-quick,  
I have destroyed my defilements. \[650\]

Seeing my fondness for the woods,  
the Sage, Who Reached the World’s End,  
the Great Sage, therefore did rank me  
foremost among the forest monks. \[651\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[652\]

Thus indeed Venerable Khadiravaniya Revata Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Khadiravaniya Revata Thera is finished.
