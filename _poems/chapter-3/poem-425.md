*\[422. {425.}*[^1] *Koraṇḍapupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
I was then a forest-worker,[^3]  
as were[^4] father and grandfathers.[^5]  
\[Earning\] my living killing beasts,[^6]  
no wholesomeness[^7] exists for me. (1) \[4529\]

In the area where I lived,  
Tissa, Chief Leader of the World,  
Eyeful One, compassionately  
showed \[me\] three \[of his own\] footsteps. (2) \[4530\]

And having seen the stepping feet  
of the Teacher known as[^8] Tissa,  
happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I pleased my heart \[about his\] feet. (3) \[4531\]

Seeing a *koraṇḍa*[^9] in bloom,  
foot-drinker growing in the earth,[^10]  
taking a sprig with \[flowers,\] I  
did *pūja* to \[those\] best of feet. (4) \[4532\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (5) \[4533\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
I’m the color of *koraṇḍa,*  
\[and\] radiantly beautiful.[^11] (6) \[4534\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of worshipping[^12] feet. (7) \[4535\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (8) \[4536\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[4537\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[4538\]

Thus indeed Venerable Koraṇḍapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Koraṇḍapupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Koraṇḍa-Flower-er”

[^3]: BJTS gloss: a hunter

[^4]: lit., “by means of,” “through”. We might say “by birth” or “in the family business”

[^5]: BJTS reads *pitumātumaten’ ahaṃ* (“with the consent of father and mother”) for PTS *pitupetāmahen’ ahaŋ.* I follow the latter reading here, noting that at \[2986\] these same two feet are repeated; there, BJTS agrees with PTS, leading me to suspect that in the present case BJTS’ mss. are corrupt. But both readings make the same point: the protagonist did his work as a hunter/animal killer as a family-approved business, not behind his parents’ backs.

[^6]: reading BJTS *pasumārena* (lit., “by” or “through” killing wild animals) for PTS *pararuhirena* (“through the blood of others”)

[^7]: *kusalaŋ*

[^8]: lit., “named”

[^9]: Sinh. *kaṭukoraṇḍu,* Barberia prionitis *(Acanth.),* cf. *koraṇḍaka, kuraṇḍaka,* a shrub and its flower, J. v.473 (RD)

[^10]: this foot consists of two different words for” tree”: *dharaṇī-rūha* (“growing in the earth”) and *pādapa* (“drinking from the feet \[or roots\]”). Though awkward in English, I translate literally here rather than give the non-descriptive “tree, which was a tree”.

[^11]: *sappabhāso,* “a shining beauty”

[^12]: lit., “doing *pūjā*”
