*Gandhathūpiya*[^1] *Chapter, the Thirty-Fourth*  
*\[331. Gandhathūpiya*[^2]*\]*  
I gave a scented stupa for  
Siddhattha \[Buddha\], Blessed One,  
enveloped by jasmine flowers  
as befitted the Sambuddha.[^3] (1) \[2931\]

The Sambuddha, the World’s Leader,  
was like a costly thing of gold,  
bright like a blue water lily,[^4]  
blazing up like a fire-altar. (2) \[2932\]

My heart was pleased \[by\] having seen  
the Chief of Monks \[who was\] seated,  
Honored by the monks’ Assembly,  
like an excellent tiger-bull,  
like a lion of good breeding,  
\[and\] pressing my hands together,  
having worshipped the Teacher’s feet,  
I departed facing the north. (3-4) \[2933-2934\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave those \[good\] scents at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of doing scent-*pūjā.* (5) \[2935\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2936\]

Thus indeed Venerable Gandhathūpiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Gandhathūpiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: PTS reads *Gandhodakaº* despite its being atypically not the name
    of the first *apadāna* in the chapter. Especially given the doubt
    about the PTS mss. transmission of this part of the text (see
    below), I am inclined to follow BJTS in this instance, too,
    supplying the expected chapter name.  
[^2]: “Scented-Stupa-er.” Cf. \#95, with which there has obviously been
    some conflation, it being nearly identitical.  
[^3]: lit., “the Buddha”  
[^4]: *indīvara,* Cassia fistula
