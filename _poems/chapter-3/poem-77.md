### \[77. Sūcidāyaka[^1]\]

Thirty thousand aeons \[ago\]  
the Sambuddha, the World-Leader,  
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks,[^2]  
was \[the Buddha\] named Sumedha. (1) \[1452\]

Five needles were given by me  
to the One of Golden Color,  
the Biped-Lord, the Neutral One,  
so that \[Buddha\] could stitch \[his\] robes. (2) \[1453\]

Because of just that needle-gift,  
knowledge did \[then\] arise in me  
with clever meanings \[and\] insights,  
sharp and quick and comfortable. (3) \[1454\]

I have burnt up \[my\] defilements;  
all existence is \[now\] destroyed.  
I am bearing my last body  
in the Supreme Buddha’s teaching. (4) \[1456\][^3]

There were four kings \[all\] with the name  
Dipadādhipati[^4] \[back then\],  
wheel-turners who had great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[1455\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1457\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sūcidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sūcidāyaka Thera is finished.
