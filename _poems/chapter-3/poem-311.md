*Ārakkhadāyaka*[^1] *Chapter, the Thirty-Second*  
*\[311. Ārakkhadāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
A fence was constructed by me  
for the Great Sage, Dhammadassi,  
and I provided protection  
for the Best Biped, the Neutral One. (1) \[2768\]  
It was eighteen-hundred aeons  
ago that I did that karma.  
Through that \[good\] karma’s remaining  
effect, I am now an arahant.[^3] (2) \[2769\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2770\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Ārakkhadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ārakkhadāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: This is the BJTS reading throughout, and the PTS reading in the
    body of this poem; I assume that the PTS reading of the chapter
    title as *Ārakkhadāya* is a typographical error  
[^2]: “Protection Giver”  
[^3]: lit., “is my attainment of the destruction of the outflows
    (*āsava*),” a much more technical way of saying the same thing.
