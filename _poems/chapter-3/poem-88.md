### \[88. Saddasaññaka[^1]\]

On a Himalayan mountain,  
\[while\] dwelling on a mat of leaves,  
I pleased \[my\] heart over the sound  
of Phussa preaching the *Dhamma*. (1) \[1539\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of good karma. (2) \[1540\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[1541\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saddasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Saddasaññaka Thera is finished.
