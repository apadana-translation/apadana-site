*\[495. {498.}*[^1] *Puḷinathūpiya*[^2]*\]*  
In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named Samaṅga.[^3]  
I had a well-built hermitage  
furnished with halls of leaves \[there then\]. (1) \[5304\]

Named Nārada, with matted hair,  
\[I\] practiced fierce austerities.  
Fourteen thousand[^4] students \[back then\]  
are worshipping[^5] me \[in that place\]. (2) \[5305\]

Being off in solitude \[then,\]  
I contemplated \[in this way\]:  
“All of the people worship[^6] me  
\[but\] I don’t worship anyone. (3) \[5306\]

I do not have an advisor;  
there is no one who speaks to me;  
no teacher \[and no\] preceptor,  
I come to a home in the woods. (4) \[5307\]

There is not a teacher for me  
whom I am giving honor to,  
and serving with respectful heart;  
my forest-dwelling’s meaningless. (5) \[5308\]

I’ll search for one to give gifts to,  
and to be respected \[by me\];  
I will live \[enjoying\] his help,  
whom no one will find blameworthy.[^7] (6) \[5309\]

\[Very\] near my hermitage,  
there was a river with high banks,  
with good slopes, which was beautiful  
\[and\] strewn about with pure white sand. (7) \[5310\]

Having approached it at that time,  
the river named named Amarika,  
after piling up \[some\] sand, I  
built a stupa \[out of that\] sand. (8) \[5311\]

“Those \[men\] who were the Sambuddhas,  
Enders of Becoming, Sages,  
I’ll make \[this\] with the marks of a  
stupa such-like \[those built\] for them.” (9) \[5312\]

Having built \[my\] stupa of sand,  
\[as though\] I made it out of gold,  
I covered \[it\][^8] with[^9] three thousand  
gold-colored *kiṅkhani*[^10] flowers. (10) \[5313\]

I am praising evening and morn,  
filled with joy, hands pressed together.  
As though facing the Sambuddha,  
I worshipped \[that\] stupa of sand. (11) \[5314\]

When defilements get produced[^11] \[or\]  
pre-occupations with the house,[^12]  
I recall \[that\] well-made[^13] stupa,  
and always look at \[them like this\]: (12) \[5315\]

“Living[^14] having depended on  
the Meaning-Conveyor,[^15] the Guide,[^16]  
it’s not appropriate for you  
to live with[^17] defilements, Good Sir.[^18] (13) \[5316\]

When I bend down at the stupa,  
then respect arises in me;  
I drive out bad reflections[^19] like  
an elephant pained[^20] by the goad. (14) \[5317\]

The King of Death[^21] \[then\] trampled me,  
conducting \[my\] life[^22] in that way.  
Passing away[^23] \[right\] on the spot,  
I went to the world of Brahmā. (15) \[5318\]

Dwelling there for the whole lifespan,[^24]  
I was born among the thirty.[^25]  
Eighty times the lord of the gods,  
I exercised divine rule \[there\]. (16) \[5319\]

And \[then\] three hundred times I was  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\],  
\[and I enjoyed\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (17) \[5320\]

I’m enjoying the results of  
three \[thousand\] *kiṅkhani*[^26] flowers.  
Twenty-two thousand \[people are\]  
waiting on me in \[every\] life. (18) \[5321\]

Due to worshipping[^27] the stupa,  
I am not soiled with dirt and dust;[^28]  
my limbs are not exuding sweat;  
I’m radiantly beautiful. (19) \[5322\]

O! the stupa well-made by me;  
Amarika River’s well-seen!  
Having built a stupa of[^29] sand,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state. (20) \[5323\]

“Field” or “Not-Field” aren’t \[distingished\]  
by a person seeking the pith,[^30]  
who desires to do wholesome deeds;  
\[his\] practice is \[thus\] accomplished.[^31] (21) \[5324\]

Just as a person with great strength  
is able to cross a river;[^32]  
carrying a protective stick,  
he would spring across a large lake,  
so I, depending on this stick,  
will cross the great sea \[of being\]:  
through \[his\] effort and energy  
a man would cross over the sea. (22-23) \[5325-5326\]  
And so too the karma I did,  
which was \[my\] little protection;[^33]  
depending on \[that\] karma done,  
I crossed over re-becoming.[^34] (24) \[5327\]

When \[my\] last rebirth was attained,  
incited by \[my\] wholesome roots,  
I am reborn in Śrāvasti,[^35]  
in a wealthy \[clan\] with big halls.[^36] (25) \[5328\]

My mother and father had faith,  
gone to the Buddha for refuge;  
they had both seen the \[deathless\] state,  
turning to the dispensation. (26) \[5329\]

Taking bark[^37] from the Bodhi \[tree\]  
they built a stupa \[made of\] gold.  
They’re praising it evening and morn,  
face to face with the Śākyas’ Son. (27) \[5330\]

They passed three watches of the night,  
praising the Buddha’s appearance,  
outside[^38] the stupa made of gold,  
on a day when the moon was full.[^39] (28) \[5331\]

I, having seen the \[gold\] stupa,  
remembered the stupa of sand.  
Sitting down on a single seat,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (29) \[5332\]

The Twenty-Second Recitation Portion  
Searching for him, the \[Great\] Hero,  
I saw the *Dhamma*’s general.[^40]  
Having departed from the house,  
I went forth in that one’s presence. (30) \[5333\]

Being \[only\] seven years old,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.  
Knowing \[my\] virtue, the Buddha,  
the Eyeful One, \[then\] ordained \[me\]. (31) \[5334\]

The work has been completed by  
me, even when \[I\] was a child;  
what’s to be done was done by me,  
in the Buddha’s[^41] dispensation. (32) \[5336\][^42]  
All hate \[and\] fear is in the past;  
all bonds overcome, \[I’m\] a sage.  
I’m you’re follower, Great Hero:  
the fruit of a golden stupa.[^43] (33) \[5337\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5338\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5339\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5340\]

Thus indeed Venerable Puḷinathūpiya[^44] Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Puḷinathūpiya[^45] Thera is finished.

    lust/sense-pleasures”)

[^13]: BJTS (and PTS alt.) read *sugataṃ* (“the Well-Gone-One”) for PTS
    *sukataŋ.* BJTS Sinhala gloss then treats it adjectivally,
    *sarvajñastupaya* (“the stupa of the Omniscient One”)

[^14]: *viharam,* fr. *viharati.*

[^15]: *sātthavāhaŋ*

[^16]: *vināyakaŋ*

    live with”

[^18]: *mārisa*, BJTS glosses *nidukāṇeni* (“O you without suffering”)

    “bad reflection” or, following the translation in the preceeding
    verse, “bad pre-occupation”)

[^20]: BJTS reads *tuttāṭṭito,* the more correct (acc. to RD) spelling
    of PTS *ºaddito*

[^21]: *maccurājā* = Māra

[^22]: *vharamānaŋ maŋ*

[^23]: *kālakato santo,* lit., “being passed away”

    nirvana) for PTS *pāragāminā* (“who has gone to the opposite shore),
    though the meaning of the latter is close to that of the former.

[^31]: reading *sādhaka* with BJTS for PTS *sārikā* (= “pithy”? PTS alt.

    (= \[544\])

[^41]: lit., “in the Śākyas’ Son’s”

[^42]: BJTS jumps from \[5334\] to \[5336\] here, inadvertently (I
    assume) omitting \[5335\] from its numbering.

[^43]: BJTS reads *soṇṇapuphass’idaṃ phalaṃ,* “that is the fruit of a
    gold-colored flower,” referring back to the *kṅikaṇi* (PTS:
    *kiṅkhani*) flowers offered to the sand-stupa (see above, v. 10
    \[5313\], cf. v. 18 \[5321\])
