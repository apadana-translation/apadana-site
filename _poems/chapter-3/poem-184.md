### \[184. Pañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ahatthiya[^1]\]

The Blessed One known as Tissa  
was the World’s Best, the Bull of Men;  
Honored by the monks’ Assembly,[^2]  
he went out onto[^3] the highway. (1) \[2169\]

Wishing to give an offering  
to achieve my vow, I picked up[^4]  
five handfuls of lotus blossoms  
and four \[more handfuls\][^5] placed by me. (2) \[2170\]

Delighted[^6] by the Buddha’s rays,  
I gave \[them\][^7] to the Best Biped,  
the Golden-Colored Sambuddha  
who was walking[^8] through the bazaar. (3) \[2171\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I offered \[those\] flowers[^9] \[to him,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (4) \[2172\]

In the thirtieth aeon hence  
there were five Subhāsammatās,[^10]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength,  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[2173\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2174\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ahatthiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ahatthiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Five-handful-er”

[^2]: lit., “honored by \[his\] followers”

[^3]: lit., “entered into”

[^4]: lit., “are picked up,” reading *paggaṇhitaṃ* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> “*‘haŋ mūgo ‘mhi*” (“I am a deer”)

[^5]: That is, nine handfuls total. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> suggests another readings of “five or four handfuls,” but the “*<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>a*” suggests that the reading 5+4 is more appropriate. The cty does not take this up.

[^6]: reading *abhituṭṭho* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *abhighuṭṭho* (“proclaimed, announced”)

[^7]: lit., “I did *pūjā* \[with them\]”

[^8]: lit., “going”

[^9]: lit., “that flower”

[^10]: that is, five men named Subhāsammatā, all of whom were rebirth precursors of Rev. Pañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ahatthiya. The name means “Well-Approved” or “Well Agreed Upon”.
