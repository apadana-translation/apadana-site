*\[369. {372.}*[^1] *Pāṭalipupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
The Blessed One named Vipassi,  
the Self-Become One, Chief Person,  
the Sun, the Victor, entered then,  
surrounded by \[all\] his students. (1) \[3225\]

Three \[fresh\] *pāṭali*[^3] flowers were  
placed \[there\] in my lap \[at that time\].  
Wishing to bathe my head I went  
to the river\[side\] bathing place.[^4] (2) \[3226\]

Going out from Bandhumatī,  
I saw the Leader of the World,  
bright like a blue water lily,[^5]  
blazing up like a fire-altar,  
excellent as a tiger bull,  
like a lion of good breeding,  
traveling in front of the monks,  
honored by the monks’ Assembly. (3-4) \[3227-3228\]  
Pleased in him, the Well-Gone \[Buddha\],  
Cleansing the Stain of Defilement,[^6]  
taking \[those\] three flowers I  
did *pūjā* to the Best Buddha. (5) \[3229\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (6) \[3230\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[3231\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pāṭalipupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pāṭalipupphiya Thera is finished.
