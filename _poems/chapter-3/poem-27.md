*\[27. Puḷinapūjaka*[^1]*\]*  
Digging out the sand which was old  
I scattered \[pure\] clean sand about  
the superb tree,[^2] the Bodhi Tree,  
of Vipassi the Blessed One. (1) \[979\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I donated that sand \[back then,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that is the fruit of giving sand. (2) \[980\]

Three and fifty aeons ago  
I was King Mahāpuḷina,[^3]  
a conqueror of the people,  
a wheel-turner, with great power. (3) \[981\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[982\]

Thus indeed Venerable Puḷinapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Puḷinapūjaka Thera is finished.
