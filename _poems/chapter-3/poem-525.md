### \[522. {525.}[^1] Supaṭadāyaka[^2]\]

Vipassi, Leader of the World,  
was rising from \[his\] siesta.  
Giving a good piece of light cloth,[^3]  
I \[then\] delighted in heaven. (1) \[5568\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that good piece of cloth,[^4]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of a good piece of cloth.[^5] (2) \[5569\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[5570\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[5571\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5572\]

Thus indeed Venerable Supaṭadāyaka[^6] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Supaṭadāyaka[^7] Thera is finished.
