### \[17. Upasena Vaṅgantaputta[^1]\]

I approached the Ultimate Man  
the Blessed Padumuttara  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
as he sat on a mountain slope. (1) \[759\]

Seeing a dinner-plate[^2] in bloom  
I plucked \[several\] stalks from it  
and, adorning an umbrella,  
I raised it over the Buddha. (2) \[760\]

\[And then\] I gave an almsgiving  
of milk-rice, delicious to eat.  
I fed eight monks who were there \[then\]  
with the Buddha as the ninth one. (3) \[761\]

The Great Hero gave thanks \[to me\]  
the Self-Become-One, Best Person:  
“Because of this umbrella gift  
there will be showers of milk-rice. (4) \[762\]

He will enjoy great happiness  
due to that pleasure in \[his\] heart.  
Thirty times as the king of gods  
he will exercise divine rule. (5) \[763\]

And twenty \[different\] times he’ll be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\],  
\[and he will have\] much local rule  
innumerable by counting. (6) \[764\]

The one whom they call Sumedha[^3]  
greatly wise,[^4] wise as is the earth,  
is going to become the Buddha  
in one hundred thousand aeons. (7) \[765\]

When the dispensation’s shining  
he will go to a human state.  
With Upasena as his name  
he’ll be the Teacher’s follower. (8) \[766\]

This is the last time I’ll exist;  
\[now\] all being has been cancelled.  
Conquering Death with his legions  
I am bearing my last body. (9) \[767\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[768\]

Thus indeed Venerable Upasena Vaṅgantaputta Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Upasena Vaṅgantaputta Thera is finished.

The Third Recitation Portion is Finished.

[^3]: This apparently refers to the rebirth precursor of Gotama Buddha, though he was Sumedha under Dīpaṃkara Buddha, whereas this poem is set in the time of Padumuttara Buddha, which was “four incalculable aeons” later.

[^4]: hearkens to his name: *sumedhasam*
