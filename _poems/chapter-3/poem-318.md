*\[318. Tiraŋsiya*[^1]*\]*  
On a mountainside, Siddhattha,  
like a lion which is well-born,  
had lit up all the directions,  
like a fire-mass[^2] on the mountain. (1) \[2806\]

Having seen Buddha’s effulgence,  
like the effulgence of the sun,  
and like the moon’s effulgence \[too\],  
great happiness arose for me. (2) \[2807\]

Seeing the three effulgences,  
seeing the Ultimate Hearer,[^3]  
placing deer-hide on one shoulder,  
I praised the Leader of the World. (3) \[2808\]

The three makers of effulgence  
dispelling darkness in the world,[^4]  
are the moon, and also the sun,  
and Buddha, Leader of the World. (4) \[2809\]

Illustrating these similes,  
I spoke praises of the Great Sage.[^5]  
Having extolled Buddha’s virtues,  
I joyed an aeon in heaven. (5) \[2810\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I extolled the Buddha \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of extolling. (6) \[2811\]

In the sixty-first aeon hence  
there was one \[man\], Ñāṇadhara,[^6]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (7) \[2812\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[2813\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tiraŋsiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Tiraŋsiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Three Rays”

[^2]: or “column of fire”

[^3]: *sāvakuttamaŋ,* which I follow BJTS gloss in treating as a
    Buddha-epithet.

[^4]: lit., “dispelling the darkness of the world in the world,”
    repeating *loka* perhaps for emphasis.

[^5]: lit., “the Great Sage was praised by me,” which creates
    syntactical confusion in English given the grammar of the first
    foot, whose subject is apparently the narrator.

[^6]: “Knowledge-Bearer”
