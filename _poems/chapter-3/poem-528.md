### \[525. {528.}[^1] Bodhisammajjaka[^2]\]

Formerly I took Bodhi leaves,  
fallen in the stupa-courtyard,  
and \[having swept,\] threw \[them\] away.  
I \[then\] obtained twenty virtues:[^3] (1) \[5585\]

Through the power of that karma,  
transmigrating from birth to birth,  
I transmigrate in \[just\] two states:  
that of a god, or of a man. (2) \[5586\]

Falling from the world of the gods,  
having come to the human state,  
I’m being born in \[just\] two clans:  
the kṣatriyan and the brahmin. (3) \[5587\]

I possess perfected limbs, \[with  
proper\] length and circumference;  
I’m very handsome \[and\] splendid,  
\[with\] complete limbs, no\[thing\] lacking. (4) \[5588\]

In the world of gods or of men,  
in whichever place I‘m reborn,  
I am golden-colored for life,  
to be compared with molten gold.[^4] (5) \[5589\]

Due to[^5] well-thrown-out Bodhi leaves,  
all of the time my outer skin  
is pliable \[and\] soft \[and\] smooth,[^6]  
\[and\] fine like a very young boy’s.[^7] (6) \[5590\]

When my body has arisen  
in whatever state of rebirth,[^8]  
I am not soiled with dirt and dust:[^9]  
the result of[^10] thrown-away leaves. (7) \[5591\]

When there is heat or burning wind,  
\[or\] through the heat of fire on it,  
on my body no sweat’s released:  
the result of thrown-away leaves. (8) \[5592\]

On \[my\] body there’s no ringworm,[^11]  
rashes,[^12] abscesses,[^13] leprosy,[^14]  
and likewise \[neither\] moles[^15] \[nor\] boils:[^16]  
the result of thrown-away leaves. (9) \[5593\]

And it has another virtue,  
being reborn life after life;  
in \[my\] body there’s no disease:[^17]  
the result of thrown-away leaves. (10) \[5594\]

And it has another virtue,  
being reborn life after life;  
there’s no torment born of the mind:  
the result of thrown-away leaves. (11) \[5595\]

And it has another virtue,  
being reborn life after life;  
for it there are no enemies:[^18]  
the result of thrown-away leaves. (12) \[5596\]

And it has another virtue,  
being reborn life after life;  
there is no lack of possessions:  
the result of thrown-away leaves. (13) \[5597\]

And it has another virtue,  
being reborn life after life;  
there is no fear in the water,  
nor from[^19] fire, from kings, \[and\] from thieves. (14) \[5598\]

And it has another virtue,  
being reborn life after life;  
slaves \[and\] slave-girls are serving \[me,\]  
in accordance with \[their own\] hearts.[^20] (15) \[5599\]

When he’s[^21] born in a human state,  
with whatever measure lifespan,  
that lifespan does not then decline,  
it lasts the lifespan’s full extent. (16) \[5600\]

Moving about inside and out,  
those from \[my\] city and country,  
are all engaged[^22] all of the time,  
wishing to grow and be happy.[^23] (17) \[5601\]

I’m wealthy, famous, splendorous;  
on the side of my relatives.  
Free of trembling and fear of ghosts,[^24]  
from every life \[to each new\] life. (18) \[5602\]

Gods \[and\] men \[and\] titans[^25] \[as well\],  
music-nymph*s*, spirits[^26] \[and\] demons;[^27]  
they are protecting \[me\] always,  
transmigrating in existence. (19) \[5603\]

Having enjoyed both \[kinds of\] fame,  
in the world of gods and of men,  
at the end I have \[now\] attained  
peaceful, unsurpassed nirvana. (20) \[5604\]

For a rich man making[^28] merit,  
specifying the Sambuddha,  
or the Bodhi of the Teacher,  
what is there that’s hard to obtain? \[5605\][^29]

Being better than the others  
in path-fruit in the religion,  
in trance, special knowledge, virtue;  
I reach nirvana, undefiled. (21) \[5606\]

Formerly, with a happy mind,  
I threw away \[those\] Bodhi leaves;[^30]  
endowed with these twenty \[virtues\][^31]  
I am existing all the time. (22) \[5607\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (23) \[5608\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (24) \[5609\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (25) \[5610\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bodhisammajjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bodhisammajjaka Thera is finished.
