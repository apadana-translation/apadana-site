*\[80. Tīṇipadumiya*[^1]*\]*  
The Victor Padumuttara,  
the One Who Surpassed Everything,  
the Tame One, with Tamed Retinue,  
Victor, departed the city. (1) \[1470\]  
I was a garland-maker then  
in the city, Haṃsavatī.  
I picked up three flower-blossoms  
which were the foremost flowers there. (2) \[1471\]  
I saw Buddha, Stainless One,  
on the road inside the bazaar,  
\[and\] having seen the Sambuddha  
I thought in this way at that time: (3) \[1472\]  
“What use are these flowers to me  
\[even if\] gifted to a king?  
I might receive a village or  
\[maybe\] a thousand village fields. (4) \[1473\]  
Doing *pūjā* to the World’s Lord  
the Untamed-Tamer,[^2] the Wise One,  
Who Conveys Bliss to All Beings,[^3]  
I will receive boundless riches.” (5) \[1474\]  
After reflecting in this way  
I brought pleasure to \[my\] own heart.  
Picking up three red-colored ones  
I threw \[those flowers\] in the air. (6) \[1475\]  
At the height to which I’d thrown them  
they were well-spread-out in the sky  
\[and\] held up over \[Buddha’s\] head,  
stalks pointing up, \[with\] blossoms down. (7) \[1476\]  
Whatever people saw \[them there\]  
\[then\] kept them thrown up \[in the air\]  
\[and\] the lesser gods, in the sky,  
let loose \[their\] cries of “Excellent!” (8) \[1477\]  
“A marvel’s produced in the world  
because of \[him\], the Best Buddha;  
we all will hear the Teaching \[now\]  
on account of \[these red\] flowers.” (9) \[1478\]  
Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the Teacher, standing on the road,  
spoke these verses \[about me then\]: (10) \[1479\]  
“I shall relate details of him  
who with red\[-colored\] lotuses  
did \[this\] Buddha-*pūjā* just now;[^4]  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (11) \[1480\]  
He’ll delight in the world of gods.  
for thirty thousand aeons \[hence\].  
For thirty aeons king of gods  
he will exercise divine rule. (12) \[1481\]  
He will always have a mansion  
that’s called Mahāvitthārikam,[^5]  
three hundred leagues raised up \[in height\];  
one hundred and fifty \[leagues\] wide. (13) \[1482\]  
And it will have well-fashioned doors  
\[fully\] forty lakhs \[in number\].  
It will have \[many\] gabled cells  
\[containing\] large \[and\] perfect beds. (14) \[1483\]  
One trillion celestial nymphs  
skilled in dancing and singing \[too\]  
\[and\] well-trained in musical arts  
will \[always\] encircle \[him there\]. (15) \[1484\]  
In a mansion such as this one  
full of companies of women  
there will be a rain of flowers  
always, divine red-colored ones. (16) \[1485\]  
Red flowers[^6] of the size of wheels  
are hanging \[there\] all of the time  
on wall pegs \[and\] on clothes hooks too,  
on door-bolts[^7] as well as arches. (17) \[1486\]  
On the inside of the mansion  
spreading out then wrapping up in  
floral blankets made of petals[^8]  
they will snuggle[^9] here[^10] all the time. (18) \[1487\]  
Those pure \[flowers\], red in color,  
will perfume with \[their\] divine scents  
a hundred leagues on every side  
of that \[heavenly\] residence. (19) \[1488\]  
Five hundred times he’s going to be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\],  
\[and he will have\] much local rule  
innumerable by counting. (20) \[1489\]  
Having enjoyed the two-fold bliss,  
unharmed by illegality,  
at the conclusion of that bliss  
nirvana will be seen \[by him\]” (21) \[1490\]  
Seeing Buddha was good for me;  
my business[^11] was put to good use.  
Doing *pūjā* with three flowers  
I \[then\] enjoyed a three-fold bliss. (22) \[1491\]  
Today I’ve attained the Teaching  
and I am \[now\] totally free;  
blooming red \[flowers\] are carried  
over the top of my \[own\] head. (23) \[1492\]  
When Teacher Padumuttara  
was speaking of my karma \[then,\]  
Dhamma-penetration occurred  
for seven thousand living beings. (24) \[1493\]  
In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I did that Buddha-*pūjā*,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of three lotuses. (25) \[1494\]  
I have burnt up \[my\] defilements;  
all existence is destroyed.  
All defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (26) \[1495\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (27) \[1496\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Tīṇipadumiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Tīṇipadumiya Thera is finished.  
The Summary:  
Samāla and Padasaññī  
Susañña, Āluvadāyaka,  
Ekasaññī, Tiṇidada,  
Sūcī, Pāṭalipupphiya,  
Ṭhitañjalī, Tipadumī:  
five and seventy verses.  
The Nāgasamāla Chapter, the Eighth.  
[^1]: “Three-Lotus-er.” BJTS reads Tipadumiya, which has the same
    meaning.  
[^2]: *adantadamakaŋ* could mean either “tamer of the untamed” or “tamer
    who is untamed;” I leave the ambiguity open with the hyphen,
    admitting here my preference for “tamer of the untamed” (which is
    also the BJTS reading, cf RD on *dametar*), and recommend
    pronunciation in chanting which through stress on the first term in
    the compound, and tone, can emphasize that the Buddha is one who
    tames those who are untamed/feral.  
[^3]: *sabbasattasukhāvaho*  
[^4]: lit., “at that time”  
[^5]: “Greatly Spread Out”.  
[^6]: the Sinhala gloss in BJTS takes the unspecified “red \[things\]”
    (*lohitakā*) to be flowers, but that isn’t specified in the text.
    BJTS presumably assumes the red things are flowers since that was
    the original gift. (The same term is used in v. \[1475\]). Cty gives
    no comment. Perhaps we should take the term as *lohitankā*, “red
    rubies?”  
[^7]: reading *dvāra-khāhāya* (BJTS) for *dvāragāhe* (“on the doors of
    the house,” PTS)  
[^8]: this follows the BJTS SInhala gloss reading of this odd usage of
    *patta* (“bowl” or “leaf”)  
[^9]: *tuvaṭṭhissanti*, “they will lie together,” Sinhala *turul vey*i.  
[^10]: reading *idha* (“here,” BJTS) for *imaŋ* (“this,” accusative
    singular, PTS).  
[^11]: lit., “trade”.
