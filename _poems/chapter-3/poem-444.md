### \[441. {444.}[^1] Bhallāṭakadāyaka[^2]\]

Spreading out a rug made of grass[^3]  
for the Gold-Colored Sambuddha,  
Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks,  
flying[^4] along the forest[^5] top,  
like a regal *sal* tree in bloom,  
I asked \[him,\] the Best of Buddhas:  
“let the Buddha show me mercy;  
I would like to give \[you\] alms food.” (1-2) \[4738-4739\]

Merciful, Compassionate One,  
Atthadassi, Greatly Famed One,  
discerning what I was thinking,  
descended to my hermitage. (3) \[4740\]

Descending, the Sambuddha then  
sat down on \[that\] mat made of leaves.[^6]  
Having taken some markingnut,[^7]  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha. (4) \[4741\]

While I meditated \[on him\],  
the Victor then consumed \[that fruit\].  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart there,  
I then worshipped \[him,\] the Victor. (5) \[4742\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I gave \[him\] that fruit back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (6) \[4743\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (7) \[4744\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[4745\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[4746\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bhallāṭakadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bhallāṭakadāyaka Thera is finished.
