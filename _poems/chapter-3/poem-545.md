### \[542. {545.}[^1] Nandaka[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the One with Eyes for everything,  
the Leader \[of the World,\] arose  
a hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[6165\]

Out of friendship for all beings,  
for \[their\] happiness and profit,  
the Best Debater, Well-Bred Man,  
practiced[^3] in \[the world\] with \[its\] gods. (2) \[6166\]

Who Reached the Height of Fame,[^4] Splendrous,[^5]  
Supported by Praise,[^6] the Victor,  
the Worshipped One[^7] of every world,  
Well-Known[^8] in all directions, (3) \[6167\]

who Crossed Over Perplexity,[^9]  
who Moved Beyond Saying “How? How?,”[^10]  
whose Mind’s Intentions are Fulfilled,[^11]  
Attained supreme Awakening.[^12] (4) \[6168\]

The Ultimate Man, Producer[^13]  
of the road to non-production,[^14]  
declared what had not been declared  
and gave birth to what was unborn. (5) \[6169\]

Road-Knower,[^15] Road-Discerner,[^16] he’s  
the Road-Teller,[^17] the Bull of Men.  
Skilled[^18] on[^19] the road, the Teacher is  
the Ultimate Best[^20] of drivers.[^21] (6) \[6170\]

Then the Great Compassionate One,  
the Leader is preaching *Dhamma*,  
lifting up beings who are stuck  
on the road \[known as\] delusion. (7) \[6171\]

The Great Sage praised a follower  
who was regarded as the best  
in exhorting of \[Buddhist\] nuns,  
\[and\] placed[^22] \[him\] in that foremost place. (8) \[6172\]

After hearing that I was thrilled.  
Inviting \[him\], the Thus-Gone-One,  
having fed \[him\] with Assembly,  
I aspired to that supreme place. (9) \[6173\]

At that time, the Lord, \[also\] thrilled,  
the Great Sage said \[these words\] to me:  
“Be happy, O long-lived one; you  
will receive that beautiful \[place\]. (10) \[6174\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (11) \[6175\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
the one whose name is Nandaka  
will be the Teacher’s follower.” (12) \[6176\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I was gone to Tāvatiṃsa. (13) \[6177\]

And now, in \[my\] final rebirth,  
I’m born in a millionaire’s clan,  
rich, prosperous, very wealthy,  
in the great city, Śrāvasti. (14) \[6178\]

Seeing the Well-Gone-One at the  
city gate, I was astonished;[^23]  
when \[he\] got Jeta Hermitage,[^24]  
I went forth into homelessness. (15) \[6179\]

After not a very long time,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.  
Then I’m one who’s crossed existence,  
instructed by the All-Seer.[^25] (16) \[6180\]

I preached *Dhamma* to the nuns \[and\]  
performed the question and answer.  
Instructed by me, all of them  
became \[arahants\], undefiled. (17) \[6181\]

Five hundred \[of them\], none lacking;  
the Great Friend,[^26] gladdened at that time,  
placed me in the foremost place of  
those who give instruction to nuns. (18) \[6182\]

Karma done a hundred thousand  
\[aeons hence\] showed me \[its\] fruit here:  
well-liberated, arrow-quick,  
I have destroyed my defilements. (19) \[6183\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (20) \[6184\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (21) \[6185\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (22) \[6186\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nandaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Nandaka Thera is finished.
