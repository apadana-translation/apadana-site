*\[223. Dverataniya*[^1]*\]*  
I was a deer-hunter back then,  
within a grove in the forest.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
Sacrificial Recipient. (1) \[2384\]  
I \[then\] gave a piece of meat to  
Vipassi \[Buddha\], the Great Sage.  
I exercised overlordship  
in the world including its gods. (2) \[2385\]  
Because of giving meat \[back then,\]  
gems[^2] came into being for me.  
I had two jewels[^3] in \[this\] world  
for attainment of worldly things. (3) \[2386\]  
I am enjoying everything  
as the profit of a meat-gift.  
I have a body which is soft  
\[and\] wisdom, a sharp intellect.[^4] (4) \[2387\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that meat at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of \[giving\] meat. (5) \[2388\]  
\[And\] in the fourth aeon ago  
there was one lord of the people.  
He was named Mahārohita,[^5]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (6) \[2389\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[2390\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Dverataniya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Dverataniya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Two-Gem-er.” BJTS reads *Dviratananiya*, which conveys the same
    meaning. The name is unusual in that it alludes to the reward rather
    than the original/“seed” karma.  
[^2]: lit., “a gem”  
[^3]: these are presumably meant to be taken as magical, wish-fulfilling
    gems  
[^4]: lit., “skillful knowing” or “intelligent knowing”  
[^5]: “Much Deer.” *Rohita* (“red”) is a type of deer.
