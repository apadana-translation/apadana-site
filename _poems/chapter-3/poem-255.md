*\[255. Sattapāṭaliya*[^1]*\]*

Seven trumpet-flower[^2] blossoms

I \[then\] offered to the Buddha,

shining like a dinner-plate tree,[^3]

sitting down within a mountain. (1) \[2515\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (2) \[2516\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2517\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sattapāṭaliya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sattapāṭaliya Thera is finished.
