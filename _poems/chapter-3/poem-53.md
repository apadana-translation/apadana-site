*\[53. Sayanadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
Padumuttara the Buddha  
had pity on the whole world.  
I donated a bed to him,  
with a mind that was very clear. (1) \[1277\]

Because of that gift of a bed,  
food would \[then\] just appear \[to me,\]  
\[like\] a seed’s yield in a good field:  
that’s the fruit of giving that bed. (2) \[1278\]

I make \[my\] bed \[up\] in the sky;  
I am carrying the \[whole\] earth;  
I have lordship over creatures:  
that is the fruit of a bed\[-gift\]. (3) \[1279\]

\[Then\] five thousand aeons \[ago,\]  
there were eight \[named\] Mahāvara;[^2]  
thirty-four hundred aeons \[hence,\]  
there were four \[kings\] with great strength. (4) \[1280\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1281\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sayanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sayanadāyaka Thera is finished.
