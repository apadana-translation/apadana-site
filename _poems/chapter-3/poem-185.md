*\[185. Isimuggadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
Like the rising hundred-rayed \[sun\],  
like the sun \[when it\] had risen,  
shining like royal ornaments,  
the Lord was Padumuttara. (1) \[2175\]

Grinding up[^2] \[some\] sage’s mung beans  
in bee’s honey devoid of bees,[^3]  
being established in pleasure,  
I gave them to the World’s Kinsman. (2) \[2176\]

Eight hundred thousand followers  
of the Buddha \[were with him\] then.  
Filling the bowls of all of them,  
\[I provided\] a huge amount. (3) \[2177\]

Because of that mental pleasure,  
incited by those happy roots,  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
I was not born in a bad state.[^4] (4) \[2178\]

In the forty-thousandth aeon  
\[ago\], they \[numbered\] thirty-eight,  
those wheel-turning kings with great strength,  
whose names were Mahisamanta.[^5] (5) \[2179\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2180\]

Thus indeed Venerable Isimuggadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Isimuggadāyaka Thera is finished.
