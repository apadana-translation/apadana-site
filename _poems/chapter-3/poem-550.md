*\[547. {550.}*[^1] *Cūlasugandha*[^2]*\]*

In this \[present\] lucky aeon

Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,

known by the name of Kassapa,[^3]

Best Debater,[^4] \[Buddha,\] arose. (1) \[6294\]

Possessing Eighty Lesser Marks,[^5]

Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks,[^6]

Having[^7] a Fathom-Wide Aura,

Gone into a Net of Light-Rays,[^8] (2) \[6295\]

as Comforting[^9] as is the moon,

Maker of Light \[just\] like the sun,

Quenching \[just\] as does a raincloud,

a Mine of Gems like the ocean, (3) \[6296\]

Through morals like earth; through wisdom

like the sky; through meditation[^10]

like Himalaya; like the wind

\[he does\] not stick to anything. (4) \[6297\]

At that very time I was born

in Benares, in a big clan,

rich in grain and abundant wealth,[^11]

with heaps of various gemstones. (5) \[6298\]

Approaching the Leader, who was

seated with a large retinue,

I heard \[him preaching\] the *Dhamma*,

undying, delighting the mind.[^12] (6) \[6299\]

Bearing the Thirty-Two Marks[^13] like

the moon with the constellations,

Possessing Eighty Lesser Marks,[^14]

like a regal *sal* tree in bloom, (7) \[6300\]

Encircled by a Net of Rays,[^15]

like a shining mountain of gold,[^16]

Having[^17] a Fathom-Wide Aura,

like the sun \[shining\] on a lake, (8) \[6301\]

Excellent Golden-Faced[^18] Victor,

like a mountain \[made\] of gemstones,

with a Heart Full of Compassion,[^19]

like the ocean through \[his\] virtue.[^20] (9) \[6302\]

The Ultimate Man, like Mt. Meru,

\[his\] Praises are Famous World-wide;[^21]

Widespread with Fame,[^22] the \[Great\] Hero,

the Sage, who is the Same as Space,[^23] (10) \[6303\]

Heart Unattached[^24] in every place,

the Leader is \[thus\] like the wind;

Support[^25] for all living beings,

the Seventh Sage is like the earth. (11) \[6304\]

\[Kassapa,\] Unsoiled by the World

like a pink lotus by water,

shines forth like a mountain of fire

Burning the Bad-Speech Undergrowth.[^26] (12) \[6305\]

Everywhere, like an antidote,[^27]

he Destroys the Defilement-Poison,[^28]

Adorned with the Scent of Virtue,[^29]

like Gandhamādana Mountain. (13) \[6306\]

The Hero’s a Mine of Virtues[^30]

like the ocean \[is\] of gemstones;

Thoroughbred Man[^31] like a Sindh horse,

he Carries Off Defilement’s Filth.[^32] (14) \[6307\]

Like a champion great soldier,

he Crushes the Army of Death;[^33]

he is like a wheel-turning king,

Lord of Wisdom’s \[Seven\] Gems.[^34] (15) \[6308\]

Just like a man of medicine,[^35]

he Doctors the Illness \[called\] Faults;[^36]

just like the very best surgeon,

he Drains[^37] the Abscess \[called False\] Views.[^38] (16) \[6309\]

At that time, the Torch of the World,[^39]

Honored by Gods along with Men,[^40]

the Sun among Men,[^41] the Victor,

preached *Dhamma* to[^42] his retinue. (17) \[6310\]

“Giving alms \[one becomes\] wealthy,

through morals one gains[^43] well-being,

through meditation, nirvana:”[^44]

thus indeed he gave instruction. (18) \[6311\]

Everyone in the retinue

hears that, \[his\] very sweet[^45] preaching,

pure in beginning, middle, end,

very tasty,[^46] like ambrosia. (19) \[6312\]

Having heard \[his\] honeyed Teaching,

pleased in Victor’s dispensation,

going to Buddha[^47] for refuge,

I praised \[him\] as long as \[I\] lived. (20) \[6313\]

At that time, for eight days \[each\] month,[^48]

I covered over the ground of

the perfumed hut \[where lived\] the Sage

with the four types of fragrant \[things\],

out of my wish[^49] for that good smell

for \[my own\] odor-free body.

Then the Victor prophesied that

\[I’d\] attain that fragrant body: (21-22) \[6314-6315\]

“He who covered over the ground

of \[my\] own perfumed hut with scents,

as the result of that karma,

\[while being\] reborn here and there,[^50]

this man will be one who has a

good-smelling body everywhere.

Having the fragrance of virtue,

he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (23-24) \[6316-6317\]

Due to that karma done very well,

with intention and \[firm\] resolve,

discarding \[my\] human body,

I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (25) \[6318\]

And now in my final rebirth,

I’m born in a clan of brahmins.

When I was dwelling in the womb,

my mother’s body was fragrant.[^51] (26) \[6319\]

And when I was departing from

\[my\] mother’s womb, then the city,

Śrāvasti, was diffused with good

scents, as though it had been perfumed. (27) \[6320\]

And a perfumed rain of flowers,

divinely-scented, delightful,

and very costly incense \[too,\]

was wafted about all that time. (28) \[6321\]

And the gods rained down on that house,

the house in which I had been born,

a perfumed \[rain\] with all good-scented

\[types of\] incense \[and\] flowers \[too\]. (29) \[6322\]

And while I, a lucky young man,

remained in the prime of \[my\] youth,

then the Charioteer of Men

guided Sela[^52] with retinue. (30) \[6323\]

I \[too\], along with all of them,

came to the city, Śrāvasti.

Seeing the Buddha’s majestic

power, I went forth at that time. (31) \[6324\]

Morals, meditation, wisdom

and the freedom that’s unsurpassed;

cultivating \[those\] four things,[^53]

I attained \[my\] arahantship.[^54] (32) \[6325\]

And when I was a renouncer,[^55]

and when I was an arahant,

and when I attained nirvana,

there was then a good-smelling rain. (33) \[6326\]

The fragrance of my body is always blowing

costly sandalwood, champaka and blue lotus.

In just that way, gone here and there I’m perfuming,

suppressing \[all\] different scents in every respect. (34)
\[6327\][^56]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (35) \[6328\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (36) \[6329\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (37) \[6330\]

Thus indeed Venerable Cūlasugandha Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Cūlasugandha Thera is finished.

The Summary:

Bhaddiya, Elder Revata,

and Sīvalī, the great getter,

Vaṅgīsa, also Nandaka,

Kāḷudāyi, thus Ābhaya,

Lomasa and Vanavaccha,

and Sugandha done as the tenth.

There are three hundred verses \[here,\]

and \[also\] sixteen more than that.

Then there is the Summary of Chapters:

The chapter called Kaṇikāra,

Phalada, Tiṇadāyaka,

Kaccāna, Bhaddiya chapter;

the verses that are counted here

are nine hundred in this[^57] \[grouping\]

and exactly eighty-four \[more\].

Five \[times\] one hundred \[plus\] fifty

*apadānas* are explained \[here\].

Along with summary verses

these are six thousand \[verses here\]

and two hundred verses \[as well\]

\[plus\] eighteen \[verses\] more than that.

To that extent the *Buddhāpadāna, Paccekabuddhāpadāna and Therāpadāna*
are finished. Let it be the basis for nirvana![^58]

The Bhaddiya Chapter, the Fifty-Fifth[^59]

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Little Good Scent,” perhaps to distinguish him from the Sugandha
    Thera whose *apadāna* appears above as \#527 {530}, with which the
    present *apadāna* shares some verses. DPPN I: 904 says he is
    probably identical with Subhūti Thera

[^3]: One BJTS alt. reads *gottena,* “by lineage”

[^4]: *vadataŋ varo*

[^5]: *anuvyañjanasampanno*

[^6]: *dvattiŋsavaralakkhaṇo*

[^7]: lit., “Surrounded by”

[^8]: *raŋsijālasamosaṭo*

[^9]: *assāsetā*

[^10]: lit., *samādhi*

[^11]: *pahūtadhanadhaññasmiŋ* taking the compound as a *dvandva*, see
    RD, *dhana* s.v. for a discussion of the options here. This is a
    stock phrase which means “rich in abundant treasures”

[^12]: *amataŋ ca manoharaŋ*

[^13]: *dvattiŋsalakkhaṇadharo*

[^14]: *anuvyañjanasampanno*

[^15]: *raŋsijālaparikkhitto*

[^16]: *ditto va kanakācalo*

[^17]: lit., “Surrounded by”

[^18]: *soṇṇānano*

[^19]: *karuṇāpuṇṇahadayo*

[^20]: reading *guṇena* with BJTS (and PTS alt., also alt. *guṇe*, “in
    virtue”) for PTS *vivaddho* (“without aging”?)

[^21]: *lokavissutakittī*

[^22]: *yasasā vitato*

[^23]: *ākāsasadiso*

[^24]: *asaṅga-citto*

[^25]: *patiṭṭhā,* support, resting place

[^26]: reading *kuvāda°* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *kupāda°.* PTS
    reads the second component of the compound as °*kaccha* (“reed,”
    “marshy land”) and BJTS reads it as *gaccha* (“shrub” “small
    plant”); “undergrowth” attempts to capture both meanings.

[^27]: *agado viya*, “counter-poison” “medicine”

[^28]: reading *kilesavisanāsako* with BJTS for PTS *°nāyako* (“he is
    the Leader of poison of the defilements”)

[^29]: *guṇagandhavibhūsito*

[^30]: *guṇānaŋ ākaro*

[^31]: *narājañño*

[^32]: *kilesamalahārako,* or “defilement’s stains”

[^33]: *mārasenāpamaddano,* BJTS reads *mārasenappamaddano*

[^34]: *bojjhaṅgaratan’issaro,* a play on the “seven gems” (the wheel,
    etc.) of the wheel-turning monarch

[^35]: *mahābhisakkasaṅkāso*

[^36]: *dosavyādhitikicchako*

[^40]: *sanarāmarasakkato*

[^41]: *narādicco*

[^42]: lit., “in”

[^43]: *sugatūpago,* lit., “approaching well-being”. Could also be read
    as: through morals approaching the Well-Gone-One

[^44]: *nibbāti,* or “he cools off”

[^45]: *mahāssādaŋ*

[^46]: *mahārasaŋ*

[^47]: lit., “to the Well-Gone-One

[^48]: reading *māse aṭṭhadinesv-ahaṃ* with BJTS for PTS *māse aṭṭhadine
    svaha*

[^49]: *paṇidhāya,* or “firm resolve”, Sinh. *prārthanāva*

[^50]: PTS *yahiŋ tahiŋ;* BJTS *tahiṃ tahiṃ*

[^51]: lit., “my mother was fragrant through her body”

[^52]: \#389 {392}, above, esp. vv.66-71 \[3648-3653\]

[^53]: or “cultivating \[those\] four in the Teaching”

[^54]: lit., “destruction of the outflows”

[^55]: or “one who had gone forth”: *pabbajito*

[^56]: this verse is in a more complex meter, with twelve-syllable feet.

[^57]: lit., “here”

[^58]: BJTS omits these two concluding lines, because the BJTS recension
    of the *apadāna* does **not** end here, even though BJTS includes
    these chapter summary verses for an incomplete hundred (*sātakaṃ*).

[^59]: BJTS places this statement above the summary, rather than after
    it
