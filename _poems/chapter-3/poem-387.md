*\[384. {387.}*[^1] *Kadalīphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
I saw the Leader of the World,  
shining like a dinner-plate tree,[^3]  
like the moon on the fifteenth day,[^4]  
blazing forth like a tree of lamps. (1) \[3314\]

Having gathered \[some\] plantain fruit,  
I \[then\] gave \[it\] to the Teacher.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
having worshipped \[him,\] I went off. (2) \[3315\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave \[Buddha\] that fruit back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[3316\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3317\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[3318\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[3319\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kadalīphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kadalīphaladāyaka Thera is finished.
