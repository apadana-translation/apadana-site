### \[366. {369.}[^1] Timirapupphiya[^2]\]

On <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andabhāgā River’s bank,  
I was going with the current.  
I saw the Spotless One, Buddha,  
like a regal *sal* tree in bloom. (1) \[3210\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
taking a *timira* flower  
to the Supreme *Pa<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">cc</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">chch</span>eka*-Sage,  
I strew \[it\] on \[that Buddha’s\] head. (2) \[3211\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* with \[that\] flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[3212\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3213\]

Thus indeed Venerable Timirapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Timirapupphiya Thera is finished.
