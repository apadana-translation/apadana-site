*Upāli Chapter, the Fifth*  
*\[41. Upāli (2)*[^1]*\]*  
The World’s Great Lord, surrounded by  
a thousand \[arahants\] undefiled,  
being one bound to solitude  
went off into seclusion \[then\]. (1) \[1116\]

I was dressed in deer-leather \[clothes\],  
carrying[^2] a triple rod[^3] \[there\].  
\[Then\] I saw the Chief of the World  
encompassed by the Assembly.[^4] (2) \[1117\]

Placing deer-hide on one shoulder,  
hands pressed together on my head,  
having worshipped the Sambuddha,  
I praised the World-Leader kindly: (3) \[1118\]

“Just as all birds, crows and so on,  
hatched from eggs or \[born out of\] sweat,  
born in wombs or viviparous,  
always travel[^5] across the sky; (4) \[1119\]

Whatever creatures may exist,  
those with and without consciousness,[^6]  
are all of them included in  
the \[great\] knowledge that you possess. (5) \[1120\]

Whatever mountain scents there are  
in the supreme Himalaya  
they all can’t match even a bit  
\[the scent\] of your morality.[^7] (6) \[1121\]

This world together with its gods  
is grasped by the darkness-makers.[^8]  
When your knowledge is shining forth  
the darkness-makers are destroyed. (7) \[1122\]

Just as creatures are in the dark  
when the sun has set \[for the day\],  
this world’s enshrouded in darkness  
when a Buddha has not appeared. (8) \[1123\]

Just as the sun when it rises  
drives away darkness every day,  
so too do you, O Best Buddha,  
destroy the darkness every day. (9) \[1124\]

You are one bent on exertion,  
Buddha in the world with \[its\] gods.  
Through their delight in your karma  
you satisfy many people.” (10) \[1125\]

\[Then\] giving thanks for all of that,  
the Great Sage Padumuttara,  
the Hero,[^9] flew into the sky  
just like a swan-king in the air. (11) \[1126\]

Having flown off, the Sambuddha,  
the Great Sage Padumuttara,  
the Teacher, standing in the sky,  
spoke these verses \[about me then\]: (12) \[1127\]

“I shall relate details of him  
who has made this praise of knowledge,  
combined[^10] with \[good\] analogies;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (13) \[1128\]

Eighteen \[different\] times he will be  
the king over \[all of\] the gods.  
He will reside upon the earth  
\[and\] have three hundred earthly reigns. (14) \[1129\]

\[Full\] five hundred times he will reign,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\],  
\[and he will have\] much local rule  
innumerable by counting. (15) \[1130\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (16) \[1131\]

Having fallen from Tusitā,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
a low ascetic with dreadlocks,  
he will be known as Upāli. (17) \[1132\]

And afterwards, having gone forth,  
driving away[^11] \[every\] evil,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled. (18) \[1133\]

And the Śākyas’ Son, Greatly Famed,  
the Buddha known as Gotama,  
pleased by his *Vinaya* knowledge  
will place him in that foremost place.”[^12] (19) \[1134\]

I, after going forth with faith,  
did \[my duty\], am undefiled.  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
without defilements I \[now\] live.[]{#BookmarkCopy1 .anchor} (20)
\[1135\]

The Blessed One did pity me;  
I am skilled in the *Vinaya*.  
Delighted by my own karma  
I’m living without defilements. (21) \[1136\]

Self-controlled in monastic rules[^13]  
and in the five organs of sense,  
I carry all the *Vinaya*  
entirely, that gemstone-mine. (22) \[1137\]

And then, discerning my virtue,  
the Teacher, the Best in the World,[^14]  
seated in the monks’ Assembly,  
did place me in that foremost place. (23) \[1138\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (24) \[1139\]

Thus indeed Venerable Upāli Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Upāli Thera is finished.  
[^1]: BJTS, Hew, and cty style him Bhāgineyya-Upāli, “Upāli the Nephew”.
    He is not to be confused with Upāli the top reciter of Vinaya,
    *Therāpadāna* \#6  
[^2]: reading *paridhārako* (BJTS, cty) or paridhāraNo (PTS alt) for PTS
    *paricāraṇo*.  
[^3]: *tidaṇḍam* = three stick, three rod. Cty glosses it as “for the
    sake of keeping pots” (*kuṇḍika-ṭṭhāpanatthāya*), apparently
    understanding it as a pingo or else some sort of tripod. But the
    more likely allusion is to the *triśula* or trident of Shiva and his
    devotees, given the deer-leather clothes.  
[^4]: lit., “the monks’ Assembly”.  
[^5]: reading *sabbe antallikkacarā sadā* (BJTS) for *sabbe antallikkhe
    padesagā* (PTS).  
[^6]: lit., “having consciousness or not having consciousness”  
[^7]: lit., “...on the ultimate mountain, Himalaya, they all are not fit
    to \[be\] even a bit of \[the good scent\] in your morality.”  
[^8]: lit., “is in the party of what causes the darkness of delusion”.
    Cf above vv. \[1072\] and \[1073\] for similar usage in a similar
    context. The BJTS reading *mohandhakārapakkhanto* allows for the
    plural, which is clear in the subsequent line of verse.  
[^9]: BJTS (and PTS alt.) reads *dhīro* (“the wise one”)  
[^10]: reading *samāyutaṃ* (BJTS, PTS alt) for *samāyanaŋ* (PTS)  
[^11]: the texts all read *virājetvāna* or *virajjitvāna*, “to shine;” I
    follow BJTS Sinhala gloss in understanding this -- as context
    warrants -- as “drive away” (Sinhala *duru koṭa*)  
[^12]: it seems that here the text *does* confuse this Upāli with Upāli
    the chief reciter of *Vinaya.*  
[^13]: lit., “in the Pāṭimokkha,” the 227 main rules which Theravāda
    Buddhist monks and nuns are required to chant fortnightly.  
[^14]: lit., Unsurpassed/Unrivaled/Without Better in the World”
