### \[443. {446.}[^1] Ambāṭakiya[^2]\]

Vessabhū, the Sage, having plunged  
into a *sal*-forest in bloom,  
sat down on a bad mountain road  
like a lion, the Well-Born-One.[^3] (1) \[4752\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I presented[^4] hog-plum[^5] \[to him\],  
the Merit-Field, the Great Hero,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by my own hands. (2) \[4753\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I offered[^6] that flower[^7] \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha*-pūjā*. (3) \[4754\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
All defilements are exhausted;  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[4755\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4756\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4757\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ambāṭakiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ambāṭakiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Hog-Plum-er”

[^3]: *abhijāto*

[^4]: lit., “did *pūjā* to”

[^5]: *ambāṭakā*, RD: “the hog-plum, Spondias Mangifera (a kind of mango).” BJTS gloss *ämbarälla*, *ämbärälla*, a small, sour, mango-like fruit which is cooked as a curry. Here the protagonist apparently offered hog-plum flowers rather than fruits (see v. 3, below)

[^6]: *abhiropayiŋ*

[^7]: though “hog-plum” evokes the small sour fruit, in the present instance the protagonist apparently offers flowers from that tree
