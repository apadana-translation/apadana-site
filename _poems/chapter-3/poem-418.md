*\[415. {418.}*[^1] *Yāgudāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
Taking someone unknown to me,[^3]  
I went[^4] to a village back then.  
Seeing a very full river,  
I approached a monastery.[^5] (1) \[4416\]

Forest-dwellers,[^6] punctilious,[^7]  
meditators,[^8] \[clad in\] coarse[^9] robes,  
wise, lovers of seclusion, were  
living in \[that\] monastery. (2) \[4417\]

Their destinies[^10] had been cut off,  
well-liberated, neutral ones;  
they did not go begging for alms  
if the river obstructed \[them\].[^11] (3) \[4418\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
awe-struck,[^12] with hands pressed together,  
taking \[some\] rice-grain that I had,[^13]  
I made a gruel-donation \[then\]. (4) \[4419\]

Giving gruel \[to those monks\] five times,[^14]  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands,  
satisfied with \[my\] own karma,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa then. (5) \[4420\]

A mansion made of gems was born  
for me in the group of thirty.[^15]  
I joyed with a group of women  
in that superb mansion \[of mine\]. (6) \[4421\]

Thirty-three times the lord of gods,  
I exercised divine rule \[there\].  
Thirty times a wheel-turning king,  
I exercised overlordship.[^16] (7) \[4422\]

There was \[also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting.  
In the world of gods or humans,  
I \[always\] enjoyed \[great\] fame. (8) \[4423\]

When \[my\] last rebirth was attained,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
As soon as[^17] \[my\] hair was cut off,  
I realized[^18] complete success.[^19] (9) \[4424\]

Due to decay, due to old age,[^20]  
contemplating[^21] this corpse[^22] \[of mine\],  
before the training rules were taught,[^23]  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (10) \[4425\]

Well-given was my superb gift;  
\[my\] trade[^24] was very well-applied.[^25]  
Because of that very gruel-gift,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state. (11) \[4426\]

I have no experience of[^26]  
sorrow \[and\] wailing \[and\] illness,  
\[nor\] distress that torments the mind:  
that is the fruit of giving gruel. (12) \[4427\]

O! \[that\] gruel was very well spent!  
Giving the monks’ Assembly gruel,  
in the unsurpassed merit-field,  
I enjoy \[these\] five good results: (13) \[4428\]

I don’t get ill, I’m beautiful,  
the Teaching quickly is observed,  
I receive \[lots of\] food \[and\] drink,  
and \[my long\] lifespan is the fifth. (14) \[4429\]

Whoever struck by awe would give  
gruel to the Assembly of monks,  
that wise person would \[also\] get  
these five \[most welcome\] benefits.[^27] (15) \[4430\]

What should be done has all been done;  
I have put an end to rebirths.[^28]  
All defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (16)[^29]  
I am wandering from village  
to village, city to city,  
extolling \[him\], the Sambuddha,  
and \[Buddha’s\] virtuous Teaching. (17)[^30]  
In the thirty thousand aeons  
since I gave that gift at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving gruel. (18) \[4431\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (19) \[4432\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (20) \[4433\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (21) \[4434\]

Thus indeed Venerable Yāgudāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Yāgudāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Gruel Donor”

[^3]: *atithiŋ me gahetvā,* lit., “taking \[someone who was\] a stranger
    to me” or “taking a stranger with me.” Cone, s.v., reads this usage
    of *atithiŋ* within the common meaning of that term, “stranger” or
    “newcomer,” and I follow suit. BJTS says an *atithi* is some sort of
    “instrument for the road,” presumably a type of vehicle, or a
    walking stick, or what have you; that would result in a translation
    like “taking my *aitithi,* I...” As becomes clear below (v. 11;
    \[4426\]), the protagonist is a merchant, traveling for the purpose
    of trade. Thus *atithi* might also refer to the merchandise he takes
    to sell or exchange.
