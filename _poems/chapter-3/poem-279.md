*\[279. Ekapuṇḍarīka*[^1]*\]*

The Self-Become, Bright \[Buddha\] then

was known by the name Romasa.[^2]

I gifted \[him\] a white lotus,

with a mind that was very clear. (1) \[2616\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I gave a white lotus back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of a white lotus. (2) \[2617\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2618\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekapuṇḍarīka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekapuṇḍarīka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “One White Lotus-er”

[^2]: Here this puzzling name is used of a Lonely Buddha.
