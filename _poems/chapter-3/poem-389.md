### \[386. {389.}[^1] Soṇakoṭivīsa[^2]\]

When Vipassi’s dispensation[^3]  
\[arose\], I made a single cave[^4]  
in Bandhumā, royal city,  
for the monks[^5] in four directions. (1) \[3326\]

Covering[^6] the floor of the cave  
with rugs, I dedicated \[it\].  
Happy, with rapture in \[my\] heart,  
I then made this aspiration: (2) \[3327\]

“Were I to please[^7] a Sambuddha  
and to get to renounce \[the world\],[^8]  
I should attain ultimate peace  
and the unexcelled nirvana.” (3) \[3328\]

Just because of those good roots,  
transmigrating ninety aeons,  
born as a god or else a man,  
I shined, a doer of merit. (4) \[3329\]

As the remainder of that deed,  
here in this final existence,  
I was born as the only son  
of <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>ampa’s foremost millionaire. (5) \[3330\]

Having heard that I had been born,[^9]  
this was the wish of my father:  
“I am giving to this \[young\] boy  
an entire two hundred million.”[^10] (6) \[3331\]

Hair four fingers wide was produced  
on the soles of both of my feet.  
It was fine and soft to the touch,  
beautiful, just like cotton wool.[^11] (7) \[3332\]

In the past for ninety aeons,  
\[and\] this \[aeon\] one more than that,  
I’ve not come to know my feet placed  
on \[any\] ground that lacks a rug. (8) \[3333\]

The Sambuddha was pleased by me;  
I went forth into homelessness.  
I have attained arahantship;  
cooled off, I am in nirvana.[^12] (9) \[3334\]

Appointed by the All-Seer  
“foremost among resolute \[monks,\]”[^13]  
\[I’m\] undefiled, an arahant,  
six knowledge-holder, powerful.[^14] (10) \[3335\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[the Buddha\] that gift then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving a cave. (11) \[3336\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[3337\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (13) \[3338\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[3339\]

Soṇa Koṭivisa Thera  
in front of the monks’ Assembly,  
being asked questions \[then\] answered  
on the great Lake Anotatta. \[3340\][^15]

Thus indeed Venerable Soṇakoṭivīsa Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Soṇakoṭivīsa Thera is finished.
