*\[503. {506.}*[^1] *Mātuluṅgaphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
I saw the Leader of the World,  
shining like a dinner-plate tree,[^3]  
like the moon on the fifteenth day,[^4]  
blazing forth like a tree of lamps. (1) \[5425\]  
Having taken a citron fruit  
I \[then\] gave it to the Teacher,  
he Worthy of Gifts,[^5] the Hero,  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[my\] own hands. (2) \[5426\]  
In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that fruit at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[5427\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5428\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5429\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5430\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Mātuluṅgaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Mātuluṅgaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.
