*\[178. Maṇipūjaka*[^1]*\]*

A small Himalayan river

flowed smoothly \[then\] along \[its\] bank.[^2]

Back then the Self-Become-One[^3] dwelt

in a field close to that \[river\]. (1) \[2137\]

With a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind,

I gave to the Buddha \[right then\]

a couch \[made by\] taking gemstones,

superb, delightful, \[and\] diverse. (2) \[2138\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I offered those gemstones \[to him\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2139\]

And in the twelfth aeon ago

there were eight \[different\] kings \[back then\],

\[all\] were known as Sataraŋsi,[^4]

wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (4) \[2140\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2141\]

Thus indeed Venerable Maṇipūjaka Thera spoke these Verses.

The legend of Maṇipūjaka Thera is finished.

[^2]: I follow the cty in this reading of the somewhat cryptic first two
    feet.

[^3]: The BJTS Sinhala gloss takes this to be Padumuttara, but the
    reference to ninety-four aeons in v. \[2139\] would suggest instead
    that it was Siddhattha.

[^4]: “Hundred-Rayed” or “Sun”
