*\[140. Piyālaphaladāyaka*[^1]*\]*

I was one who harmed others then,

a harmer of other beings.[^2]

I rested on a \[mountain\] slope

near the Teacher \[known as\] Sikhi. (1) \[1934\]

In the evening and the morning

I saw the Buddha, the World-Chief.

\[But\] I had nothing to give to

the Biped-Lord, the Neutral One. (2) \[1935\]

Taking a *piyāla* fruit, I

went into the Buddha’s presence.

The Blessed One accepted \[it\],

the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men. (3) \[1936\]

Thenceforth for the sake of others

I waited on \[Sikhi\], the Guide,[^3]

\[and\] with that pleasure in \[my\] heart

I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (4) \[1937\]

In the thirty-one aeons since

I gave that fruit \[to the Buddha\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of giving fruit. (5) \[1938\]

In the fifteenth aeon ago

there were three \[men named\] Mālabhi,

wheel-turning kings with great power,

possessors of the seven gems. (6) \[1939\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1940\]

Thus indeed Venerable Piyālaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Piyālaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.

The Summary:

Sobhī and Sudassana too,

Candana, Pupphachadana,

Raho and Campakapupphī

and with Atthasandassaka,

Ekadussī, Sāladada

\[and\] Phaladāyaka, the tenth.

By counting there are clearly \[here\]

seventy verses plus two \[more\].

The Sobhita Chapter, the Fourteenth.

[^1]: “Piyāla-Fruit-Donor” *Piyāla* (Sinh. *piyal*) is buchanania
    latifolia*.* PTS omits “Piyāla,” hence reads the name merely as
    “Fruit-Donor”. Cf. below, \#497 {500}, for a (different) *apadāna*
    ascribed to a monk of this name.

[^2]: *pārādhaka/parādhaka* (BJTS) or *parodhaka* (PTS, cty) seems to be
    a neologism. The cty glosses it as *para-satta-rodhaka* (“harmer of
    other beings”) and as *vihesaka*, “vexer”. The BJTS Sinhala gloss
    gives “a destroyer of others’ breaths/other beings, a *vädd*a (Sri
    Lankan aborigine, hunter)”. I read *parapāṇu*° (“other beings
    \[lit., “ones with breath”\],” BJTS) for *paramāṇu* (“atoms,” PTS)
    in the compound in the second foot.

[^3]: *vināyakaŋ*
