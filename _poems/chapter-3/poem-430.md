*\[427. {430.}*[^1] *Sovaṇṇakattarika*[^2]*\]*  
The Self-Composed One,[^3] the Buddha,  
the Self-Tamer,[^4] Attentive One,[^5]  
Wandering the Path of Brahmā,[^6]  
Delighting in Mental Relief,[^7] (1) \[4617\]

the Flood-Crosser,[^8] the Sambuddha,  
Who Loves Meditation \[and\] Trance,[^9]  
the Sage, the Seated One,[^10] Attainer,[^11]  
Brilliant as Blue Lotus Petals:[^12] (2) \[4618\]

I approached \[him,\] the Best Buddha,  
taking a gourd[^13] to hold water.  
After washing the Buddha’s feet,  
I gave that \[water-\]gourd \[to him\]. (3) \[4619\]

The Sambuddha \[then\] had \[it\] fetched,  
the Leader, Padumuttara,  
“Bringing \[more\] water with this \[gourd,\]  
place it at the soles of my feet.” (4) \[4620\]

Agreeing, saying, “Excellent,”  
and with respect for the Teacher,  
carrying water with the gourd,[^14]  
I brought it to the Best Buddha. (5) \[4621\]

The Great Hero gave thanks \[for that,\]  
quenching \[the anguish in\] my heart,  
“Because of giving \[me\] this gourd,  
let what you think be accomplished.” (6) \[4622\]

For fifteen[^15] aeons \[after that,\]  
I delighted in the gods’ world,  
and thirty times I was a king,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (7) \[4623\]

Whether by day or else by night,  
walking back and forth or standing,  
a water pot[^16] made out of gold  
is standing \[right\] in front of me. (8) \[4624\]

Giving a gourd to the Buddha,  
I receive a gold water-pot:  
the deed done with little trouble[^17]  
becomes huge like that \[later on\]. (9) \[4625\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave \[him\] that gourd back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] a gourd. (10) \[4626\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (11) \[4627\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[4628\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (13) \[4629\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sovaṇṇakattarika[^18] Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sovaṇṇakattarika[^19] Thera is finished.  
The Summary:  
Sakiŋsammajjaka Thera,  
Ekadussī, thus Āsanī,  
then Kadamba \[and\] Koraṇḍa,  
Ghataŋ, also Savanika,  
Sucintita, Kiṇkhanika,  
and Soṇṇa-Kattarika[^20] too:  
there are a hundred verses here  
plus seventy-one \[more verses\]

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Golden Scissors” or “Golden Walking-stick-er” or (following BJTS, and preferred) “Golden Water-jug-er”. BJTS (and PTS alt) reads the name *Soṇṇakontarika,* see below, n. to \[4624\]

[^3]: reading *manobhāvanīyaṃ* with BJTS for PTS *manobhāvaniyaŋ;* BJTS Sinhala gloss *sambhāvanīya vū*

[^16]: reading *kontaraṃ* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *kattara* in \[4624\], \[4625\]*. Kattara* is a knife or a walking stick; *kattarikā* a pair of scissors; *konta* (RD) “a pennant or standard”. BJTS gloss on *kontaraṃ* is *keṇḍiyak*, a pot or jar, ewer or can (with a spout). Cone guesses “a lance?” for this passage (see *kontara,* s.v.), but I take the BJTS reading (even though I do not find any warrant for it beyond the context), given the correspondence between the gift (a water-gourd) and the result (a water-pot made of gold).
