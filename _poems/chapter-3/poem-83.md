*\[83. Nipannañjalika*[^1]*\]*  
Seated at the foot of a tree  
I became extremely diseased.  
In the forest grove I attained  
an extremely pitiful state. (1) \[1512\]

Having taken pity on me,  
the Teacher, Tissa, approached \[me\].  
As I lay \[there dying I then\]  
pressed both my hands over my head. (2) \[1513\]

With a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind,  
having worshipped[^2] the Sambuddha,  
the Ultimate Among Beings,  
I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (3) \[1514\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I worshipped[^3] \[him\], the Best Person,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of worshipping. (4) \[1515\]

In the fifth aeon after that  
there were five \[named\] Mahāsikha,[^4]  
wheel-turning kings with great power  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[1516\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1517\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nipannañjalika Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Nipannañjalika Thera is finished.
