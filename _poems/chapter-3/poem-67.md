*\[67. Vatthadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
I was born as a bird back then,  
with good \[strong\] wings,[^2] a harpy-king.  
I saw the Stainless Buddha go  
on Gandhamādana \[Mountain\]. (1) \[1393\]  
Shedding my harpy appearance,  
I got dressed in human clothing.  
One piece of cloth I gave to the  
Lord of Bipeds, the Neutral One. (2) \[1394\]  
Having taken that piece of cloth,  
the Buddha, the World’s Top Leader,  
the Teacher, standing in the sky  
spoke these verses \[about me then\]: (3) \[1395\]  
“Because of the gift of this cloth  
and the resolve in \[his own\] heart,  
abandoning the harpy womb  
he’ll delight in the world of gods.” (4) \[1396\]  
But Atthadassi, Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
after praising the gift of cloth  
\[then\] departed facing the north. (5) \[1397\]  
When I’m reborn in existence  
attainments of cloth befall me;  
there’s a canopy in the sky:  
that is the fruit of giving cloth. (6) \[1398\]  
Seven men \[named\] Aruṇaka  
were wheel-turners with great power.  
In the thirty-fourth aeon \[hence\]  
they were the lords over people. (7) \[1399\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[1400\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Vatthadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Vatthadāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Cloth-Donor”  
[^2]: BJTS (and some PTS alt) reads suvaṇṇo (“with good color” or
    “golden”) for supaṇṇo (PTS, lit., “good leaves”) but the cty agrees
    with PTS and glosses *supaṇṇo* as *supatto* (“good wings”), so I
    translate accordingly.
