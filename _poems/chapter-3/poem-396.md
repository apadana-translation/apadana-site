*\[393. {396.}*[^1] *Bakkula*[^2]*\]*  
In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named Sobhita.  
My well-constructed hermitage  
was built by \[my\] own students \[there\]. (1) \[3758\]

There were many canopies there,[^3]  
and flowering Chinese chaste trees.[^4]  
There were many wood-apple[^5] trees,[^6]  
and *jīvajīvaka*s[^7] in bloom. (2) \[3759\]

There were many *nigguṇḍi*[^8] trees,[^9]  
jujube,[^10] also gooseberry,[^11]  
*phārusaka*[^12] and bottle-gourds[^13]  
and white lotus[^14] flowers in bloom. (3) \[3760\]

There was *āḷakā* and bel[^15] there,  
plantain*,*[^16] and also citron[^17] trees;  
there was lots of sugarcane[^18] there,  
arjuna[^19] and *piyaṅguka.*[^20] (4) \[3761\]

Neem*,*[^21] *salalā,*[^22] yellow  
cheesewoods,[^23] banyan,[^24] wood-apple trees,[^25]  
my hermitage was one like that;  
I lived \[there\] with \[my\] students then. (5) \[3762\]

Anomadassi, Blessed One,  
the Self-Become One, World-Leader,  
looking for a secluded place,  
\[then\] came up to my hermitage. (6) \[3763\]

When the Great Hero had approached,[^26]  
Anomadassi of Great Fame,  
suddenly \[some\] internal pain,[^27]  
arose for the Lord of the World. (7) \[3764\]

Wandering in the hermitage,  
I saw the Leader of the World.  
Having approached the Sambuddha,  
the Eyeful One, he of Great Fame,  
and having seen his deportment,[^28]  
I diagnosed him at that time:  
“without a doubt \[some\] illness has  
been born \[inside\] of the Buddha.” (8-9) \[3765-3766\]  
Wishing to practice medicine,  
I ran back[^29] to the hermitage.  
In the presence of my students,  
I then addressed \[all my\] students. (10) \[3767\]

All the students were respectful;  
having listened to what I said,  
they assembled in one group for  
me, who respected the Teacher. (11) \[3768\]

Having quickly scaled a mountain,  
I fetched[^30] all of the healing herbs.[^31]  
Making \[them\] into a liquid,[^32]  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha. (12) \[3769\]

When the Great Hero consumed[^33] \[it\],  
the Omniscient One, World-Leader,  
quickly \[that\] illness[^34] was suppressed[^35]  
for the Well-Gone-One, the Great Sage. (13) \[3770\]

Having seen \[his\] distress relieved,[^36]  
Anomadassi of Great Fame,  
after sitting on his own seat,  
spoke these verses \[to us back then\]: (14) \[3771\]

“This one who gave me medicine  
and \[thereby\] relieved my disease,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (15) \[3772\]

For one hundred thousand aeons  
he’ll delight in the world of gods.  
When instruments[^37] are sounded there,  
this one constantly will be thrilled. (16) \[3773\]

Coming to the world of humans,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
a thousand times he’ll be a king,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (17) \[3774\]

In the fifty-fifth aeon \[hence\]  
he’ll be the king[^38] named Anoma,[^39]  
lord of the grove of rose-apples,[^40]  
victorious on \[all\] four sides.[^41] (18) \[3775\]

A wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems,  
he will exercise sovereignty,  
making even the heavens shake.[^42] (19) \[3776\]

\[Whether\] born human or divine,  
he’ll be one with little disease.  
Throwing away \[his\] possessions,[^43]  
he’ll transcend[^44] illness in the world. (20) \[3777\]

Aeons beyond measure from now,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (21) \[3778\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (22) \[3779\]

Burning up \[all his\] defilements  
he will cross the flood of clinging.  
He’ll be the Teacher’s follower,  
\[the monk\] whose name is Bakkula. (23) \[3780\]

Having come to know all of this,  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly  
will place \[him\] in that foremost place.”[^45] (24) \[3781\]

Anomadassi, Blessed One,  
the Self-Become One, World-Leader,  
looking for a secluded place,  
came to my hermitage \[back then\]. (25) \[3782\]

With all the healing herbs I served  
the Great Hero who had approached,  
Omniscient One, the World-Leader,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands. (26) \[3783\]

I can’t even \[start\] to spend the  
harvest[^46] of that seed well-planted,[^47]  
that karma I did well for him,  
well done by me so long ago.[^48] (27) \[3784\]

My gains were well-obtained be me  
who saw the Leader \[of the World\];  
through the remainder of that deed,  
I realized the deathless state. (28) \[3785\]

Having come to know all of that,  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly  
\[has\] placed in that foremost place. (29) \[3786\]

In the vast number of aeons  
since I did that karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of medicine. (30) \[3787\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
All defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (31) \[3788\]

My being in Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (32) \[3789\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (33) \[3790\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bakkula Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Bakkula Thera is finished.

[^2]: “Two-families Bi-Kin” (see DPPN II:261). Also spelled Bākula,
    Vakkula. A historical monk, renounced at the age of eighty and

    fish and later recovered from its belly. Remembered for providing
    medicines to Buddhas and monks in previous lifetimes; named the best
    in good health by the Buddha of this era. Also remembered as a monk
    who practiced asceticism without preaching it to others. Subject of

    years as a monk (he dies at the age of 160).

[^31]: *sabbosadham*. Though not stipulated, the sense may be “all the
    medicinal herbs required for the medicine I wished to make for the
    Buddha,” rather than every medicinal herb that exists, though either
    interpretation is possible and I have tried to leave the translation
    as open as the Pāli.  
[^32]: *pānīyayogaŋ katvāna,* lit., something like “having prepared them
    through liquifaction” or “making them drinkable.” He takes the herbs
    and prepares them into a liquid medicine for the Buddha (presumably
    by cleaning, chopping, boiling, squeezing then filtering them).  
[^33]: *paribhutte*, “was one who made use of,” i.e., who took the
    medicine.  
[^34]: *vāto,* lit., “wind”. The term invokes the illness itself, “a
    disease of the wind,” which would involve an imbalance (usually an
    excess) of that humor over the other two (bile and phlegm). The cure
    would thus involve eliminating or “suppressing” *vāta* to restore
    the healthy balance of the three humors.

[^45]: Bakkula was foremost among those of good health (DPPN II: 262,
    citing A.1.25; “for a problem connected with this, see Mil. 215ff.),
    and this verse apparently refers to that. Thus the “all of that”
