*\[324. Saññasāmika*[^1]*\]*  
I was \[only\] seven years old,[^2]  
a learned master of mantras.  
Carrying on the family line,  
I encouraged sacrifice\[s\]. (1) \[2841\]

Eighty-four thousand \[living\] beasts,  
are slaughtered by me every day.  
Brought to a wooden hitching post,[^3]  
they are kept for sacrificing. (2) \[2842\]

Like beaten[^4] \[gold\] atop a forge,[^5]  
\[burning bright\] like cedar charcoal,[^6]  
like the sun \[when it\] is rising,  
like the moon on the fifteenth day,[^7]  
Siddhattha, Goal of All Success,  
Worshipped[^8] by the Triple World, Friend,[^9]  
the Sambuddha, having approached  
\[me\] uttered this speech \[then and there\]: (3-4) \[2843-2844\]  
“Non-violence to all that breathe,  
young man, is \[what best\] pleases me,  
and abstaining from stealing \[things\],  
transgressing and drinking liquor. (5) \[2845\]

I am pleased by good behavior,  
and gratitude for the learned;  
praiseworthy too are those things \[done\]  
for others in \[this\] world of things. (6) \[2846\]

Having cultivated those things,  
delighting in kindness to all,[^10]  
pleasing \[your\] heart in the Buddha,  
cultivate the ultimate Path.” (7) \[2847\]

Saying this, the Omniscient One,  
the World’s Best, the Bull among Men,  
having thus given me advice,  
rose into the sky and flew off.[^11] (8) \[2848\]

Beforehand having cleansed \[my\] heart,  
I later brought \[my\] heart pleasure.  
Because of that mental pleasure,  
I was reborn in Tusitā. (9) \[2849\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I brought \[that\] pleasure to \[my\] heart,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of perceiving Buddhas. (10) \[2850\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[2851\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saññasāmika Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Saññasāmika Thera is finished.
