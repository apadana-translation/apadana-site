### \[309. Buddhasaññaka[^1]\]

In a dream I saw \[the Buddha\],  
the World’s Leader, Siddhattha,  
like the rising hundred-rayed \[sun\],  
\[bright but cool\] like a rayless sun,  
the World’s Best, the Bull among Men,  
who’d gone into the forest \[then\].  
Bringing pleasure to my heart there,  
I approached the Well-Gone \[Buddha\]. (1-2) \[2759-2760\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I obtained that perception then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of perceiving Buddhas. (3) \[2761\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2762\]

Thus indeed Venerable Buddhasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Buddhasaññaka Thera is finished.
