## Vibhīṭaki[^1] Chapter, the Forty-Fifth

### \[438. {441.}[^2] Vibhīṭakamiñjaya[^3]\]

Kakusandha, the Great Hero,  
was a Master of Everything.  
Alienated [^4] from the group,  
he went into the forest \[then\]. (1) \[4717\]

Having gathered numerous seeds,[^5]  
I strung them on a \[piece of\] vine.  
At that time the Blessed One was  
meditating on a mountain. (2) \[4718\]

Having seen the God of Gods, I,  
with a mind that was very clear,  
presented \[all those\] seeds to \[him\],  
the Hero, Deserving of Gifts. (3) \[4719\]

Within the \[present\] aeon, since  
I gave that fruit \[to him\] back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of numerous seeds. (4) \[4720\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[4721\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4722\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4723\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vibhīṭakamiñjaya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Vibhīṭakamiñjaya Thera is finished.

[^2]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^5]: *bījabījaŋ*, taking the reduplication as indicative of a large number, “seeds and seeds.” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss interpolates “*bulu*” (*bahera*, “bastard myrobolan,” *vibhītaka*), identifying the type of seed on the basis of the protagonist’s name (as it appears in the colophon), even though the Pali does not specify it. Cty (p. 487) eliminates even the clue in the name, calling this monk *Bījabījadāyaka* (“Numerous Seeds Donor”) after this distinctive term in the text. However, cty proceeds to specify, like <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>, that these were *vibhīṭaka* \[Sinhala *buḷu*, beleric myrobalan, bastard myrobalan, *Terminalia bellirica*\] seeds and even to explain that “the meaning is: ‘having allowed *vibhīṭaka* fruits to mature, taking the seeds \[that is\] the kernels, mixing \[them\] with honey \[and\] sugar, I gave them to Kakusandha, the Blessed One’”
