*\[48. Cankamadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
Having heaped up \[the ground\] with bricks,  
I had a walkway constructed  
for Atthadassi, the \[Great\] Sage,  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One. (1) \[1207\]  
That walkway was very well made  
with the five gemstones piled up \[high\].  
It was a hundred hands in length  
\[and\] pleasant for meditation. (2) \[1208\]  
The Blessed One accepted \[it\] --  
Atthadassi, the Best of Men --  
\[and\] with his hand sifting \[some\] sand,  
he uttered these verses \[aloud\]: (3) \[1209\]  
“Because of this gift of \[some\] sand  
and of this walkway, so well made,  
\[this one\] is going to enjoy sand  
and will possess the seven gems. (4) \[1210\]  
For three aeons among the gods  
he will exercise divine rule.  
Surrounded by celestial nymphs  
he will enjoy \[great\] happiness. (5) \[1211\]  
Having come to the human realm  
he’ll be the king of a country,  
and three times as a wheel-turner  
he will reside on the \[great\] earth.” (6) \[1212\]  
In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I did that \[good\] karma \[then,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of a walkway. (7) \[1213\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[1214\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Cankamadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Cankamadāyaka Thera is finished.
