*\[497. {500.}*[^1] *Piyālaphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
I was formerly a hunter,  
wandering in the woods back then.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
\[who was\] Master of Everything. (1) \[5353\]

Carrying a *piyāla* fruit,  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha,  
the Field of Merit, the Hero,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands. (2) \[5354\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that fruit at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[5355\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5356\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5357\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5358\]

Thus indeed Venerable Piyālaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Piyālaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.  
The summary:  
Kiṅkhani[^3] and Paŋsukūla,  
Koraṇḍapupphi,[^4] Kiŋsuka,  
Upaḍḍhadussī, Ghatada,  
Udaka, Thūpakāraka,  
Naḷāgārī is the ninth one,  
Piyālaphaladāyaka.  
There are one hundred verses \[here\],  
and nine \[verses\] more than that \[too\].  
The Kiṅkhanipupphiya Chapter, the Fiftieth.[^5]  
Then there is the Summary of Chapters:  
Metteyya Chapter, Bhaddāli,[^6]  
and Sakiŋsammajjaka too;  
one chapter \[called\] Vibheṭakī,  
Jagatī, Sālapupphiya,  
Naḷamāla, Paŋsukūla,  
and thus[^7] Kiṅkhaṇipupphiya.[^8]  
There are eighty-two verses \[here\]  
and also fourteen hundred \[more\].  
The Ten Chapters[^9] called Metteyya.[^10]  
The Fifth Hundred[^11] is finished.[^12]

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Piyāla-Fruit-Donor” *Piyāla* (Sinh. *piyal*) is *buchanania
    latifolia.* PTS omits “Piyāla,” hence reads the name merely as
    “Fruit-Donor”. Cf. above, \#140, for a (different) *apadāna*
    ascribed to a monk of this name. Cf. below, \#508 {511} for
    (virtually) the same *apadāna* ascribed to a monk of a different
    name. The only difference there is the name of the fruit that is
    donated, and hence of the donor as well.

[^3]: BJTS reads *kiṅkaṇi*

[^4]: BJTS reads *koraṇḍamatha,* “and then Koraṇḍ”

[^5]: BJTS places this line before, rather than after the summary.

[^6]: this is the BJTS reading for PTS “Metteyya, Bhaddāli Chapter”

[^7]: reading *tathā* with BJTS (and PTS alts.) for PTS *tadā* (“then”
    “back then” “at that time”)

[^8]: BJTS reads *kiṅkaṇi*

[^9]: *vaggadasakaŋ*

[^10]: not in PTS

[^11]: *sataka* is a common structure in Sanskrit and Pāli poetry,
    usually referring to one hundred verses, rather than (as here) one
    hundred stories.
