### \[497. {500.}[^1] Piyālaphaladāyaka[^2]\]

I was formerly a hunter,  
wandering in the woods back then.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
\[who was\] Master of Everything. (1) \[5353\]

Carrying a *piyāla* fruit,  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha,  
the Field of Merit, the Hero,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands. (2) \[5354\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that fruit at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[5355\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5356\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5357\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5358\]

Thus indeed Venerable Piyālaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Piyālaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Piyāla-Fruit-Donor” *Piyāla* (Sinh. *piyal*) is *buchanania latifolia*. <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> omits “Piyāla,” hence reads the name merely as “Fruit-Donor”. Cf. above, \#140, for a (different) *apadāna* ascribed to a monk of this name. Cf. below, \#508 {511} for (virtually) the same *apadāna* ascribed to a monk of a different name. The only difference there is the name of the fruit that is donated, and hence of the donor as well.

[^3]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *kiṅkaṇi*

[^4]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *koraṇḍamatha*, “and then Koraṇḍ”

[^5]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> places this line before, rather than after the summary.
