*\[339. {342.}*[^1] *Tīṇuppalamāliya*[^2]*\]*  
On Candabhāgā River’s bank,  
I was a monkey[^3] at that time.  
I saw the Stainless Buddha \[who\]  
was seated on a mountainside. (1) \[3084\]

I was enraptured seeing \[him\],  
Shining Forth in All Directions,  
like a regal *sal* tree in bloom,  
Bearing the Great and Lesser Marks.[^4](2) \[3085\]

Happy, with \[my\] heart exultant,  
\[and my\] mind bristling with joy,  
I offered on \[the Buddha’s\] head  
three \[lovely\] blue lotus flowers. (3) \[3086\]

After offering \[those\] flowers  
to Vipassi, the Greatest Sage,  
approaching him respectfully  
I \[then\] departed facing north. (4) \[3087\]

Crouched over[^5] going off \[from there,\]  
with a mind that was very clear,  
I alighted on a mountain  
\[and\] attained the end of \[my\] life. (5) \[3088\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,[^6]  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (6) \[3089\]

And \[afterwards,\] three hundred times,  
I ruled over the \[world of\] gods.  
And \[furthermore\] five hundred times  
I was a king who turned the wheel. (7) \[3090\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that flower-*pūjā* \[then\]*,*  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (8) \[3091\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[3092\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tīṇuppalamāliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Tīṇuppalamāliya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Three Blue Lotus-er” or “Three Waterlily-er”. BJTS reads *Tiuppalamāliya*

[^3]: *vānara.* This is the elegant grey langur (Sinh. *vandurā*) as opposed to the cruder rhesus monkey (Sinh. *rilavā*)

[^4]: *lakkhaṇavyañjanûpetaŋ,* i.e., the thirty-two primary marks and eighty lesser or minor marks that adorn the body of a great man (*mahāpurusa*) who is destined to be either a wheel-turning monarch or a Buddha.

[^5]: taking *paṭikuṭiko* (BJTS reads *patiº*) as fr. *paṭikuṭati* “to crouch,” “to bend over” (as does apparently BJTS, glossing the term *häkiḷī = vakuṭu vu*). This may mean that he went off still bowing in reverence, or else that he went off on all fours.

[^6]: note that this oft-repeated foot has not been modified to indicate thathe discarded a simian body, not a human one.
