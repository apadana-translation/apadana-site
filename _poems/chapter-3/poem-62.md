*\[62. Āvopupphiya\]*  
Departing the monastery  
he came forward on the walkway  
declaring the Four \[Noble\] Truths,  
preaching the state of deathlessness. (1) \[1355\]

Discerning the words of Sikhi,  
the Best Buddha, the Neutral One,  
picking up various flowers  
I threw \[them\] up into the sky. (2) \[1356\]

Through that karma for the Buddha,[^1]  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state  
beyond \[all\] conquest and defeat. (3) \[1357\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I honored \[him\] with flowers \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of flower-*pūjā.* (4) \[1358\]

Twenty aeons ago \[I was\]  
Sumedha the Kṣatriyan,  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[1359\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1360\]

Thus indeed Venerable Āvopupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Āvopupphiya Thera is finished.
