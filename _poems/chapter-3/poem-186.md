*\[186. Bodhiupaṭṭhāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
In the city, Rammavati,  
I was \[a man\] named Muraja.[^2]  
Committed to ceaseless service,  
I went to the great Bodhi \[tree\]. (1) \[2181\]

Morning and evening exerting,  
incited by those happy roots,  
throughout eighteen hundred aeons  
I was not born in a bad state.[^3] (2) \[2182\]

In the fifteen hundredth aeon  
I was a king, ruler of men,  
known by the name of Damatha,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (3) \[2183\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2184\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bodhiupaṭṭhāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Bodhiupaṭṭhāyaka Thera is finished.
