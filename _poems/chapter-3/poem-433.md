### \[430. {433.}[^1] Pāṭihīrasaññaka[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
entered the city at that time,  
with a hundred thousand masters.[^3] (1) \[4655\]

When the Very Peaceful One, the  
Neutral One, entered the city,  
\[many\] gems shone brilliantly, \[and\]  
there was a loud noise all the time. (2) \[4656\]

Through the Buddha’s \[great\] majesty,[^4]  
drums were being played and beaten;  
the lutes[^5] were played all by themselves,  
when Buddha entered the city. (3) \[4657\]

I’m honoring[^6] the Best Buddha,  
Padumuttara, Great Sage;  
after seeing the miracle,  
I pleased \[my own\] heart \[over it\]. (4) \[4658\]

“O! the Buddha! O! the Teaching!  
O! our Teacher’s \[great\] achievement!  
Through no \[one’s\] will, the instruments  
are being played all by themselves!” (5) \[4659\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I obtained that perception,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of perceiving Buddhas. (6) \[4660\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (7) \[4661\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[4662\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[4663\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pāṭihīrasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pāṭihīrasaññaka Thera is finished.
