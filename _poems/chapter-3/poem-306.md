### \[306. Sampasādaka[^1]\]

“Praise to you, O Buddha-Hero!  
You are the Clear One everywhere.  
Calamity’s befallen me;  
become the refuge for this me.” (1) \[2740\]

Siddhattha \[Buddha\], in the world  
the Peerless One,[^2] explained to \[me\]:[^3]  
“The \[Monks’\] Assembly, ocean-like,  
is without measure, unexcelled.  
Bring your heart pleasure in the monks[^4]  
and plant the seed of happiness  
there in that field which has no flaws,  
which provides fruit without limit.”[^5] (2-3) \[2741-2742\]

Saying that, the Omniscient One,  
the World’s Best, the Bull among Men,  
after instructing me that way,  
rose up into the sky, the sky![^6] (4) \[2743\]

Not long after the Bull of Men,  
Omniscient One, had gone his way,  
the \[time of my own\] death arrived;  
I was reborn in Tusitā. (5) \[2744\]

Then in that field which has no flaws  
which provides fruit without limit,  
in the monks, having pleased my heart,  
I joyed an aeon in heaven. (6) \[2745\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I received that pleasure back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[feeling\] pleasure. (7) \[2746\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2747\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sampasādaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sampasādaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Great Pleasure-er”

[^2]: *loke appaṭipuggalo*

[^3]: lit., “to him,” *tassa*, from the *tassa me* in the prior verse.

[^4]: lit., “in the Assembly (*saṅghe*)”

[^5]: *anantaphaladāyaka*. In addition to playing on this monk’s name, this epithet supplied the Sangha (in the mouth of a previous Buddha) fits the (over?-)extended agricultural metaphor at work here: the Sangha is a fertile field in which the mental pleasure of an ordinary person is itself the seed of future happiness. The term used for “field,” *khetta* in the locative, is also evocative of the first verse/setting of the roughly contemporaneous (+/-) *Bhagavad-gītā*, which opens, *dharmakṣetre kurukṣetre*

[^6]: taking the redundancy (*vehāsam nabham*) as emphatic
