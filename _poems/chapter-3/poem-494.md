### \[491. {494.}[^1] Kiŋsukapupphiya[^2]\]

Seeing a pulas tree[^3] in bloom,  
stretching out hands pressed together,  
recalling Siddhattha Buddha,  
I offered *pūjā* in the sky. (1) \[5273\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (2) \[5274\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[5275\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5276\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5277\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5278\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kiŋsukapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kiŋsukapupphiya Thera is finished.
