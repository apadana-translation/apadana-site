*\[326. Annasaŋsāvaka*[^1]*\]*  
Causing the Sambuddha to stay[^2] --  
the Golden-Colored Sambuddha,  
like something costly made of gold,  
Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks,  
Siddhattha, Goal of All Success,  
the Lustless One, Unconquered One,  
who was going through the bazaar --  
I fed \[that Sambuddha\], Great Sage. (1-2) \[2858-2859\]  
The Sage, Kind \[to creatures\] in the world,  
blazed forth \[his bright light\] on me then.  
Pleasing my heart in the Buddha,  
I joyed an aeon in heaven. (3) \[2860\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that alms food back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving alms food. (4) \[2861\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2862\]

Thus indeed Venerable Annasaŋsāvaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Annasaŋsāvaka Thera is finished.
