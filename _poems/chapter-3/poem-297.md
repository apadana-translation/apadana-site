### \[297. Desakittiya[^1]\]

Back then I was a brahmin man  
whose name was Upasālaka.[^2]  
Seeing the World’s Best One, Man-Bull,  
Getting the World’s Sacrifices,  
plunged into the woods, the forest,  
I worshipped \[the Buddha’s\] feet \[there\].  
Discerning my mental pleasure,  
the Buddha disappeared \[right there\]. (1-2) \[2701-2702\]

Having come out of the forest,  
I called to mind the Best Buddha.  
Proclaiming that to the region,  
I joyed an aeon in heaven. (3) \[2703\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I proclaimed that to the region,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of proclaiming. (4) \[2704\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2705\]

Thus indeed Venerable Desakittiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Desakittiya Thera is finished.
