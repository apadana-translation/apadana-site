*Mandārapupphiya*[^1] *Chapter, the Thirty-Seventh*

*\[358. {361.}*[^2] *Ekamandāriya*[^3]*\]*

Coming here from Tāvatiṃsa,

I was a man named Maṅgala.[^4]

Taking a *mandārava* bloom,

I carried \[it\] over the head

of Vipassi \[Buddha\], Great Sage,

seated \[then\] in meditation.[^5]

I carried it \[thus\] for a week,

\[then\] returned to the world of gods. (1-2) \[3180-3181\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I did *pūjā* to the Buddha,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[3182\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3183\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekamandāriya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekamandāriya Thera is finished.

[^1]: BJTS reads *Mandāravaº,* the preferred Pāli spelling.

[^2]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^3]: “One *Mandāra* \[Flower\]-er.” *Mandārava* (skt. *mandāra*) is the
    coral tree, Erhythrina fulgens (RD Erythmia Indica), also one of the
    five celestial trees whose flowers fall from the world of the gods.
    BJTS reads, probably more correctly, *Mandāravapupphiya.* In this
    context the reference seems to be to the divine, rather than the
    earthly *mandāra(va),* so I leave the term untranslated, rather than
    give “One Coral Tree \[Flower\]-er”

[^4]: “Auspicious,” “Festival,” “Lucky,” also the name of a previous
    Buddha.

[^5]: lit., “with (in) *samādhi*”
