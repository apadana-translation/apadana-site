### \[290. Pubbaṅgamaniya[^1]\]

Eighty-four thousand \[great people\]  
renounced the world, nothing at all.  
I gave precedence to them \[then,\]  
wishing for the ultimate goal. (1) \[2665\]

In this world of lust and being,  
they carefully attended on  
the Undisturbed One,[^2] Lucid One,[^3]  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[their\] own hands. (2) \[2666\]

\[Their\] Faults Destroyed,[^4] Defects Expelled,[^5]  
they Did their Duty, Free of Fault,[^6]  
Pervading \[all\] with Loving Hearts,  
Self-Become Ones, Unconquered Ones; (3) \[2667\]

remembering those Sambuddhas,[^7]  
having given service to them,  
when the \[time of my\] death arrived,  
I went to divine existence. (3-4) \[2668\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I protected morals back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of being restrained. (5) \[2669\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2670\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pubbaṅgamaniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pubbaṅgamaniya Thera is finished.
