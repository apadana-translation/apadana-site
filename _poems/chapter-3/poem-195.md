*\[195. Aṅkolaka*[^1]*\]*

Seeing an *aṅkola* in bloom

with excellent flowers and buds,[^2]

having plucked a flower \[from\] it,

I went to the Buddha’s presence. (1) \[2236\]

In that period Siddhattha

was the Hidden One,[^3] the Great Sage.

Honoring him for a moment,

I tossed that bloom into the cave. (2) \[2237\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I offered that flower \[to him\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2238\]

In the thirty-sixth aeon hence

I was one Devagajjita,[^4]

a wheel-turning king with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2239\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2240\]

Thus indeed Venerable Aṅkolaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Aṅkolaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Alangium Donor.” The *aṅkola* (Sinh. *rukaṅgana*; Alangium
    hexapetalum, a.k.a. sage-leaved alangium) is a flowering tree

[^2]: reading *mālāvaraṃ sakosakaṃ* with BJTS for PTS
    *māhāsārasamotataŋ*

[^3]: *patilīna*; as is clear in the fourth foot, he is “hidden” within
    a cave

[^4]: “Roaring (or Thunder, or Furious Elephant) of the Gods”
