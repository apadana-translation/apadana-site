*\[172. Nisseṇidāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
I had a stairway constructed  
for ascending up the palace  
of Koṇḍañña, the Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One. (1) \[2112\]  
Due to that pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
having attained \[great\] happiness,  
I am bearing my last body  
in the Supreme Buddha’s teaching. (2) \[2113\]  
In the thirty-one thousandth aeon  
there were three \[people\] at that time,  
kings who turned the wheel \[of the Law\],  
\[all\] named Pahasambahula.[^2] (3) \[2114\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2115\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Nisseṇidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Nisseṇidāyaka Thera is finished.
