*Chatta Chapter, the Fifteenth*  
*\[141. Adhicchattiya*[^1]*\]*  
When the Blessed One passed away,[^2]  
Atthadassi, the Ultimate Man,  
having an upper parasol made,[^3]  
I placed it on \[his\] stupa \[then\]. (1) \[1941\]  
Coming \[there\] from time to time, I  
venerated the World-Leader.  
Having a floral cover made  
I placed it on the parasol. (2) \[1942\]  
I exercised divine rule in  
the seventeenth aeon \[ago\].  
I didn’t go to the human state:  
that’s the fruit of stupa-*pūjā.* (3) \[1943\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[1944\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Adhicchattiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Adhicchattiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Upper Parasol-er”  
[^2]: lit., “reached nirvana”  
[^3]: cty explains *chattādhichattaṃ* as an umbrella above another
    umbrella, which were (and in places still are) common ornaments of
    stupas,.
