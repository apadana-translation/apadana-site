### \[136. <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>ampakapupphiya[^1]\]

\[I saw Buddha\], the Morning Star,[^2]  
shining like a dinner-plate tree,[^3]  
sitting down within a mountain,  
surveying all the directions. (1) \[1909\]

There were three young brahmin men then,  
well-trained in their own \[brahmin\] arts.[^4]  
Taking ascetics’ provisions,  
they were coming up behind me. (2) \[1910\]

In a bag were seven flowers  
those ascetics had laid down \[there\].  
Having picked them up I gave them  
for the knowledge of Vessabhu. (3) \[1911\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I offered those flowers \[to it\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of knowledge-*pūjā*. (4) \[1912\]

In the twenty-ninth aeon \[hence,\]  
\[a king\] known as Vihatābha,[^5]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[1913\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1914\]

Thus indeed Venerable <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>ampakapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>ampakapupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>ampaka-Flower-er”. The *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampaka* (Sinh. *sapu*) tree is *Magnolia champaca*, formerly classified as *michelia champaca*. English names for the tree include Champak, Joy Perfume Tree, Yellow Jade Orchid Tree and Fragrant Himalayan Champaca. It was the Bodhi tree of the seventeenth Buddha of the *Buddhavaṃsa*, Atthadassi. It has highly fragrant cream to yellowish-colored blossoms.

[^2]: *osadhī*. RD (s.v.) points out that all we really know about this star is that it was particularly bright, leading Childers to translate it as “Venus” and others as the morning star.

[^3]: *kaṇṇikāra*, *kaṇikāra* = Sinhala *kinihiriya*, Pterospermum acerifolium, produces a brilliant mass of yellow flowers; Engl. a.k.a. karnikar, bayur tree, maple-leaf bayur, caniyar (now archaic?), dinner-plate tree; Bodhi tree of Siddhattha Buddha.

[^4]: presumably sacrificing, chanting mantras, and forth.

[^5]: “Bright Light”
