*\[315. Pupphâsaniya*[^1]*\]*  
The golden-colored Sambuddha,  
just like the hundred-raying sun,  
was traveling near by \[to me\],  
Siddhattha, the Unconquered One. (1) \[2787\]  
Going out to meet \[the Buddha,\]  
having \[him\] enter \[my\] ashram,  
I gave \[him\] a seat of flowers,  
with a mind that was very clear. (2) \[2788\]  
Pressing both my hands together,  
at that time I was overjoyed.  
Pleasing my heart in the Buddha,  
I turned that karma to \[my\] use. (3) \[2789\]  
I’m pure in the dispensation  
because of all that wholesomeness,[^2]  
the merit made by me in the  
Unconquered One, the Self-Become. (4) \[2790\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave that floral seat back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of giving floral seats. (5) \[2791\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2792\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Pupphâsaniya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pupphâsaniya Thera is finished.
