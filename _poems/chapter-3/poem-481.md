*Paŋsukūla Chapter, the Forty-Ninth*  
*\[478. {481.}*[^1] *Paŋsukūlasaññika*[^2]*\]*  
The Blessed One named Tissa was  
a Self-Become One, Foremost Man.[^3]  
Leaving \[behind\] his robe of rags,  
the Victor entered \[his\] dwelling.[^4] (1) \[5031\]

Taking \[my\] bow which had been stretched,[^5]  
wandering for the sake of food,[^6]  
with[^7] a circular sword[^8] \[as well,\]  
I entered into the grove \[then\]. (2) \[5032\]

There I saw \[the Buddha’s\] rag-robe,  
stuck up in the top of a tree.[^9]  
Throwing down the bow right there,  
having pressed my hands on \[my\] head, (3) \[5033\]

happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
and with a huge \[amount of\] joy,  
remembering the Best Buddha,  
I worshipped \[his\] robe of rags \[then\].  
In the ninety-two aeons since  
I worshipped that rag-robe \[back then,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of worshipping. (4) \[5034-5035\][^10]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[5036\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5037\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[5038\]

Thus indeed Venerable Paŋsukūlasaññika Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Paŋsukūlasaññika Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Rag-robe Perceiver”  
[^3]: *aggapuggalo*  
[^4]: or, “the monastery”: *vihāraŋ*  
[^5]: reading *vitataṃ* with BJTS for PTS *tiyantaŋ* (‘with three
    strings” \[?\])  
[^6]: reading *bhakkhatthāaya cariṃ ahaṃ* with BJTS for PTS *akkhitto
    yamaliŋ ahaŋ* (“struck by a pair”)  
[^7]: *gahetvāna,* lit., “taking”  
[^8]: *maṇḍalaggaŋ*  
[^9]: I follow the cty and BJTS Sinhala gloss in taking *dumagge* as
    *duma + agge*. It would also be possible to take it as *du+ magge*,
    “on a bad road”. Cf. v. \[592\] above for a case comparable to the
    latter. Though I do follow it here, the cty and BJTS reading rather
    begs the question how the Buddha’s rag robes got up in the tree.  
[^10]: PTS omits the first two feet of \[5035\] (“In the ninety-two
    aeons since/I worshipped that rag-robe \[back then,”) and adds the
    second two feet of it to \[5034\], treating its v. 4 as a six-footed
    verse.
