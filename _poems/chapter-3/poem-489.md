### \[486. {489.}[^1] Dhammarucī[^2]\]

When Dipaṅkara was Buddha,  
the Victor said of Sumedha:  
“Aeons beyond measure from now,  
this one will become a Buddha. (1) \[5193\]

The one named Māyā’s going to be  
the birth-mother of this \[person\];  
Suddhodhana the father’s name;  
this one will be \[named\] Gotama. (2) \[5194\]

Being one bent on exertion,  
having practiced austerities,  
the Sambuddha will awaken[^3]  
Great Famed, at the Bodhi tree’s roots.[^4] (3) \[5195\]

Upatissa[^5] and Kolita[^6]  
will be the \[two\] chief followers;[^7]  
the one whose name is Ānanda  
will attend upon this Victor. (4) \[5196\]

Khemā and Uppalavaṇṇā  
will be chief female followers;[^8]  
Citta and Ālavaka will  
be the chief pious laymen.[^9] (5) \[5197\]

Khujjuttarā, Nandamātā  
will be chief pious laywomen;[^10]  
the Bodhi tree of this Hero  
is known as the Aśvattha tree.”[^11] (6) \[5198\]

After having heard those words of  
the Great Sage, the Unequaled One,[^12]  
overjoyed, \[both\] gods[^13] and men, are  
praising \[him\], hands pressed together. (7) \[5199\]

At that time I was a young man,  
well-educated, named Megha.[^14]  
Having heard \[that\] best prophesy  
for Sumedha, \[then\] a great sage,  
cultivating confidence in  
Sumedha, font[^15] of compassion,  
\[when\] that hero renounced the world,[^16]  
I renounced right along with \[him\]. (8-9) \[5200-5201\]

Restrained[^17] in the monastic rules,[^18]  
and \[also\] in the five senses,  
he lived pure, mindful, a hero,  
doer of what the Victor taught.[^19] (10) \[5202\]

\[While\] I was living in that way,  
I strayed away[^20] from the good road,  
urged into bad behavior by  
a certain evil friend \[of mine\]. (11) \[5203\]

Having been controlled by reason,[^21]  
I fell from the dispensation;[^22]  
afterward, by that bad friend, the  
murder of \[my\] mother was schemed. (12) \[5204\]

I did no-interval karma,[^23]  
and I killed with an evil mind;  
I fell from there \[right into\] hell,[^24]  
born in a very cruel \[place\]. (13) \[5205\]

Being gone to that woeful state,[^25]  
I long transmigrated in pain,[^26]  
not seeing the Hero again,  
Sumedha, the Bull among Men. (14) \[5206\]

In this aeon, in the ocean,  
I was a *timiṅgala* fish.[^27]  
Having seen a ship in the sea,  
I approached it looking for food. (15) \[5207\]

Seeing me, the traders, afraid,  
remembered the Best of Buddhas;  
I heard a huge sound shouted out,  
“Gotama!” \[they cried in terror\]. (16) \[5208\]

Recalling the past perception,  
I passed away \[right\] on the spot.  
I was reborn in Śrāvasti,  
a brahmin in a high-ranked clan. (17) \[5209\]

My name was Dhammarucī \[then\],  
a loather of every evil.  
Having seen the Lamp of the World,  
being \[only\] seven years old, (18) \[5210\]

I went to great Jetavana,[^28]  
\[and\] went forth into homelessness.  
I approach the Buddha three times  
\[every\] night, also \[every\] day. (19) \[5211\]

Seeing \[me\], seeing \[me,\] the Sage  
called \[me\] “long time Dhammarucī.”  
After that I told the Buddha  
\[how my\] past karma had progressed: (20) \[5212\]

Very long, marked with hundreds of good deeds,[^29]  
conditions \[then\] gradually[^30] purified.  
Today I am looking closely indeed,  
I am seeing your body without compare. (21) \[5213\][^31]

Very long, darkness is destroyed by it.[^32]  
Through guarding[^33] purity, the stream[^34] has been cleansed.  
Very long, \[now\] purified without fault,  
is the eye made out of knowledge, O Great Sage. (22) \[5214\]

A long time, \[now\] come together with you;  
not destroyed, again the interval was long;  
today, again come together with you,  
O Gotama, deeds do not \[just\] disappear. (23) \[5215\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (24) \[5216\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (25) \[5217\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (26) \[5218\]

Thus indeed Venerable Dhammarucī Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Dhammarucī Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Splendor of the Teaching”.

[^3]: *bujjhissati*, from the same root as Buddha (lit., “Awakened”)

[^4]: lit., “of an *asattha* tree.” The *asattha* (Skt. *aśvattha*) tree, ficus religiosa, is the Bodhi tree of Gotama Buddha (Sinh. *bō gasa*)

[^5]: i.e., Sāriputta (*Thera-apadāna* \#1)

[^6]: i.e., Mahā-Moggallāna (*Thera-apadāna* \#2)

[^7]: *sāvakā*, “voice-hearers,” accompished arahant monks

[^8]: *sāvikā*

[^9]: *upāsakā*, devout laymen who observe eight precepts, more monk-like than ordinary Buddhists who observe the five precepts.

[^10]: *upāsikā*

[^11]: The *asattha* (Skt. *aśvattha*) tree is ficus religiosa (Sinh. *bō gasa*)

[^12]: *asamassa*

[^13]: *°marū*, in the more general sense of “gods” (as opposed, I suppose, to the *maruts* of Vedic mythology to which the term most directly applies

[^14]: “Cloud”

[^15]: *āsaya*, lit., “abode” “haunt” “support for” “vessel of”

[^16]: or “went forth”

[^17]: *saŋvuto*

[^18]: lit., “in the recitation,” “in the *Pātimokkha*,” the (in the Pāli *vinaya*, 227) rules recited at monthly *uposatha* gatherings of Buddhist monks, ideally encapsulating the whole of monastic law.

[^19]: *jinasāsanakārako*

[^20]: or “was lost,” *paridhaŋsito*

[^21]: or thinking, *vitakka-vasa-go* (BJTS *vitakka-vasīko*)

[^22]: *sāsanato*, lit., “from the dispensation”

[^23]: *anantariyañ*, a deed whose result is immediate descent into the lowest Avīci (“no interval”? “no pleasure”?) hell, “a deadly sin,” of which there are five: patricide, matricide, killing an arahant, shedding the blood of a Buddha (it is impossible to kill one), and dissension in the Sangha (monks’ Assembly).

[^24]: lit., “into *avīci*, which is particularly gruesome. See DPPN I:199ff.

[^25]: or “suffering,” *vinīpatagato*

[^26]: or “suffering,” *dukkhito*

[^27]: of mythical proportions, the largest fish in the sea, maybe even “sea monster”

[^28]: the “Jeta Grove” in which Anāthapiṇḍika built the famous hermitage for the Buddha, the location of many of the *sutta*\s.

[^29]: lit., “merits,” *°puñña°*

[^30]: reading *patipubbena* with BJTS for PTS *patipubbe na* (“in the past, not…”)

[^31]: PTS and BJTS agree in presenting this and the following two verses in a different, more complex meter than the rest of the poem (and indeed, different from the meter in the vast majority of the whole *Apadāna* collection), with 10-11-10-11 syllable counts per quatrain (10-11-10-12 in the present instance, perhaps due to the superfluous *‘haŋ*). I have translated accordingly.

[^32]: reading *tayā* with BJTS (and PTS alts.) for PTS *mayā* (“by me”)

[^33]: *suci-rakkhena*, a play on words that echoes the “very long \[time\]” (*su-ciraṃ*) governing these verses. Or is this *sucira* + *akkhena*, “by the eye for very long,” picking up the “eye” (*nayana*) reference in the fourth foot?

[^34]: or river (*nadī*) of existence, or of doubt (as in \#485 {488} above, v. 7 = \[5183\]
