*\[482. {485.}*[^1] *Candanamāliya*[^2]*\]*

Giving up the five sense pleasures,[^3]

forms which are dear and delightful;

giving up eight hundred million,

I went forth into homelessness. (1) \[5105\]

After going forth I gave up

bad karma[^4] \[done\] with the body.

Giving up bad conduct through words,

I dwelt upon a river’s banks. (2) \[5106\]

\[Then\] the Best Buddha approached me,

living alone[^5] \[near that river\].

I did not know, “he’s the Buddha;”

I gave \[him\] a friendly welcome.[^6] (3) \[5107\]

Giving \[him that\] friendly welcome,

I \[then\] asked \[him\] his name and clan:

“Are you a god, a music-nymph*,*

or[^7] \[even\] generous Indra? (4) \[5108\]

Or else who are you? Son of whom?

\[Like\] God Himself[^8] has come here \[now\],

you’re shining in all directions,

like the sun \[when it is\] rising. (5) \[5109\]

\[Marks of\] wheels with one thousand spokes

are seen on your foot, happy one.[^9]

Who then are you? The son of whom?

How \[then\] can we \[come to\] know that?

Please declare \[your\] name and \[your\] clan;

please \[do\] relieve \[me\] of my doubts!” (6) \[5110\][^10]

“I’m not a god, a music-nymph,

nor \[even\] generous Indra,

and I do not exist as God:

I am superior to them. (7) \[5111\]

In the past I burst asunder

their sphere, the chains of sense pleasures;[^11]

having destroyed all defilements,

the best Awakening’s attained.[^12] (8) \[5112\]

After hearing those words of his,

I spoke these words \[to him back then\]:

“If you’re a Buddha, O Great Sage,

please sit down \[here\], Omniscient One.

I am going to worship[^13] you;

you’re the Ender of Suffering. (9) \[5113\][^14]

Spreading out my deer-hide leather,

I gave it to the Teacher \[then\].

The Blessed One sat down there like

a lion in a mountain cave. (10) \[5114\]

Quickly ascending a mountain,

I gathered a mango \[tree\]’s fruit,

a beautiful *sal* flower and

\[some\] very costly sandalwood. (11) \[5115\]

Quickly taking all of that, I

approached the Leader of the World.

Giving the fruit to the Buddha,

I offered \[him that\] *sal-*flower. (12) \[5116\]

Anointing \[him with\] sandalwood,[^15]

I then worshipped \[him\], the Teacher,

happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,

\[and\] with a huge \[amount of\] joy. (13) \[5117\]

Seated on \[my\] deer-leather \[robe\],

Sumedha, Leader of the World,

\[then\] praised my karma at that time,

causing me to smile[^16] \[about that\]: (14) \[5118\]

“Due to this gift of \[mango\] fruit,

\[and\] of both perfume \[and\] flowers,

for twenty-five hundred aeons

he will delight in the gods’ world.

With intentions not lacking thought,[^17]

he will be very powerful.[^18] (15) \[5119\][^19]

For twenty-six hundred aeons

he will delight in the gods’ world.

He’ll be a king who turns the wheel,

victorious on \[all\] four sides.[^20] (16) \[5120\]

The City known as Vebhāra,

constructed by Vissakamma,

will be entirely made of gold,

adorned with various gemstones. (17) \[5121\]

By means of that very method,

he’ll transmigrate judiciously.

Being happy in every place,

\[whether\] as a god or human,

when he obtains \[his\] last rebirth,

he will be \[born as\] a brahmin. (18) \[5122\][^21]

Having departed from the house

he will be one without a home.

Mastering special knowledges,[^22]

he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (19) \[5123\]

Having said that, that Sambuddha,

Sumedha, Leader of the World,

while I meditated \[on him,\]

\[then\] departed into the sky. (20) \[5124\]

Due to that karma done very well,

with intention and \[firm\] resolve,

discarding \[my\] human body,

I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. \[5125\][^23]

Having fallen from Tusitā,

I was born in a mother’s womb.

There is no lack of possessions,

\[even\] when I am in the womb. (21) \[5126\]

Food and \[also\] drink are enjoyed,

even when I’m in mother’s womb;

due to my desire they’re produced

for \[my\] mother as \[she\] wishes. (22) \[5127\]

When I was \[only\] five years old,

I went forth into homelessness.

I attained \[my\] arahantship

while \[my\] hair was being cut off. (23) \[5128\]

Searching out \[my\] former karma,

I did not see \[it\] like a child;[^24]

I remembered karma for

\[the whole\] thirty thousand aeons. (24) \[5129\]

“Praise to you, O Well-Bred Person![^25]

Praise to you, Ultimate Person!

Coming in your dispensation,

I’ve attained the unshaking state. (25) \[5130\]

In the thirty thousand aeons

since I worshipped[^26] the Buddha \[then\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (26) \[5131\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (27) \[5132\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (28) \[5133\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (29) \[5134\]

Thus indeed Venerable Candanamāliya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Candanamāliya Thera is finished.
