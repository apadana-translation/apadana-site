*Suvaṇṇabimbohana Chapter, the Twenty-Eighth*  
*\[271. Suvaṇṇabimbohaniya*[^1]*\]*  
I donated a single chair,  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[my\] own hands,  
and I \[also\] gave a pillow,  
wishing for the ultimate goal. (1) \[2582\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I donated that pillow \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of a pillow. (2) \[2583\]

In the sixty-third aeon hence  
was the ruler[^2] named Asama,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2584\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2585\]

Thus indeed Venerable Suvaṇṇabimbohaniya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Suvaṇṇabimbohaniya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Gold-Pillow-er”. The term (properly *bimbohana*) derives from the shape of the fruit of the *Bimbijala* tree, Momordica monadelpha, Bodhi tree of Dhammadassi Buddha. While PTS uses this spelling in the colophon, and BJTS and PTS alternative use it here, PTS gives *Suvaṇṇabibbohaniya,* presumably a typo.

[^2]: kṣatriyan

[^3]: “Unique” or “Unmatched”
