### \[286. Upaṭṭhāyaka[^1]\]

After I had invited him —  
the World’s Best, the Bull of Men,  
the Best Biped, Great Elephant,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
who had entered onto the road —  
service was provided by me  
to Siddhattha \[Buddha\], Great Sage,  
the Well-Wisher of Every World.[^2] (1-2) \[2646-2647\]

Accepting \[it\], the Sambuddha,  
the Greatest Sage, \[then\] rose up from  
that seat \[prepared\] for serving \[him\]  
\[and\] set forth, his face to the west. (3) \[2648\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that service back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving service. (4) \[2649\]

In the fifty-seventh aeon  
hence, \[lived\] he named Balasena,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[2650\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered:  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2651\]

Thus indeed Venerable Upaṭṭhāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Upaṭṭhāyaka Thera is finished.
