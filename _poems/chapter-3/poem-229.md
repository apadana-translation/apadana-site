*\[229. Sukatāveḷiya*[^1]*\]*  
Back then \[I\] was named Asita,[^2]  
\[and\] I was a garland-maker.  
Picking up a flower-garland,[^3]  
I went[^4] to give it to the king. (1) \[2415\]  
Not having \[yet\] met with[^5] the king,  
I saw the Leader, Sikhi.  
Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha. (2) \[2416\]  
In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2417\]  
In the twenty-fifth aeon hence  
I was a king who had great strength,  
known by the name of Dvebhāra,[^6]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (4) \[2418\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2419\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Sukatāveḷiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sukatāveḷiya Thera is finished.
