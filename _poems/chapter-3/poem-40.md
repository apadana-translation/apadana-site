*\[40. Kapparukkhiya*[^1]*\]*  
Affixing[^2] decorated cloth  
on the front of the best stupa  
of Siddhattha, the Blessed One,  
I set up a wishing-tree \[there\].[^3] (1) \[1110\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
a wishing-tree’s \[established there,\][^4]  
making my doorway beautiful. (2) \[1111\]

I, along with my retinue,  
and whoever’s attached to me  
getting cloth from that \[wishing-tree\]  
we clothe ourselves all the time. (3) \[1112\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I set up that \[wishing-\]tree then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a wishing-tree. (4) \[1113\]

In the seventh aeon ago  
eight kṣatriyans named Sucela[^5]  
were wheel-turners who had great strength,  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[1114\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1115\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kapparukkhiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kapparukkhiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Wish-Fulfilling-Tree-er”

[^2]: reading *laggetvā* (BJTS, cty) for *langhetvā* (PTS)

[^3]: *kapparukkha* (lit., “aeon tree”) typically refers to a tree in
    heaven that grants all wishes. Especially given the reference to
    affixing a decorated cloth, this may allude to a picture of such a
    tree painted on cloth, rather than being a claim that an actual
    wish-fulfilling tree was donated at the stupa. Alternately, in
    contemporary Sri Lanka, a *kapruk pūjā* is one in which a “tree” or
    stand, constructed of sticks or metal, is set up and donors are
    encouraged to hang money and objects as gifts on it. Given the
    allusion in v. (3) \[1112\] to getting cloth from the *kapparukkha,*
    this may be the best interpretation of the term in this context, but
    for a metaphorical usage of the term cf. v. \[26\], above

[^4]: lit., “a wish-fulfilling tree gets established.” On wishing-tree,
    see previous note.

[^5]: “Good Cloth”
