*Bandhujīvaka Chapter, the Sixteenth*

*\[151. Bandhujīvaka*[^1]*\]*

\[I saw\] him, Stainless like the moon,

Pure \[and\] Bright, Unagitated,

\[his\] Delightful States Exhausted,

Crossed \[far\] beyond ties to the world,

making people reach nirvana,

Crossed, and helping others to cross,

meditating in the forest,

Tranquil and Fully Self-Controlled. (1-2) \[1993-1994\]

Then, threading[^2] *bandhujīvaka*[^3]

flowers along a piece of string,

I offered \[them\] to the Buddha,

Sikhi, the Kinsman of the World. (3) \[1995\]

In the thirty-one aeons since

I did that \[good\] karma back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[1996\]

In the seventh aeon ago

the lord of humans, greatly famed,

there was a strong wheel-turning king

who was named Samantacakkhu.[^4] (5) \[1997\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1998\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bandhujīvaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bandhujīvaka Thera is finished.
