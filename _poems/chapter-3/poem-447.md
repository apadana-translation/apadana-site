### \[444. {447.}[^1] Sīhāsanika[^2]\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I gave a lion-throne \[to him,\]  
Padumuttara, Blessed One,  
the Well-Wisher of All Creatures.[^3] (1) \[4758\]

In the world of gods or of men,  
wherever I am living \[then\],  
I’m receiving a huge mansion:  
that’s the fruit of a lion-throne. (2) \[4759\]

Many couches[^4] made out of gold,  
made of silver, made of rubies,  
made of gemstones, made of crystal,  
are produced for me all the time. (3) \[4760\]

Making a seat for the Bodhi  
of the \[Buddha\] named “Best Lotus,”  
I’m born in an exalted clan;  
O! the Teaching’s propriety![^5] (4) \[4761\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I made \[him that\] lion-throne,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a lion-throne. (5) \[4762\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (6) \[4763\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4764\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[4765\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sīhāsanika Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sīhāsanika Thera is finished.
