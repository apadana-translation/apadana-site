*\[213. Saccasaññaka*[^1]*\]*

In that period Vessabhu

Honored by the monks’ Assembly,[^2]

is preaching the \[Four\] Noble Truths,[^3]

quenching \[the lust\] of the people. (1) \[2329\]

Recipient of great mercy,

I went into that multitude.

Being seated \[there\] that I \[then\]

heard the Teaching of the Teacher. (2) \[2330\]

After hearing his Teaching I

\[then\] went to the world of the gods.

For thirty thousand aeons I

dwelt there in the gods’ city. (3) \[2331\]

In the thirty-one aeons since

I obtained that perception then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of perceiving truths. (4) \[2332\]

In the twenty-sixth aeon hence

there was one lord of the people;

his name was Ekaphusita,[^4]

a wheel-turning king of great strength. (5) \[2333\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2334\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saccasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Saccasaññaka Thera is finished.
