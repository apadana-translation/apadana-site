*\[305. Phaladāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
On Bhāgīrathī[^2] River’s bank,  
there was a hermitage back then.  
I went to that hermitage \[once\],  
expectantly, fruit in \[my\] hands. (1) \[2736\]

I saw Vipassi \[Buddha\] there,  
\[bright but cool\] like a rayless sun.[^3]  
I donated to the Teacher  
all of the fruit I had \[in hand\]. (2) \[2737\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave that fruit \[to him\] back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[2738\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2739\]

Thus indeed Venerable Phaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Phaladāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Fruit Donor.” cf. \#87, \#127, \#140, \#282 (more? xxx)  
[^2]: this is the BJTS spelling; PTS gives *Bhāgīrasī*
