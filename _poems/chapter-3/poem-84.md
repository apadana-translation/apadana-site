*\[84. Adhopupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
The chief follower of Sikhi  
was the monk known as Abhibhū,  
with vast powers, a three-fold knower,  
he went to the Himalayas. (1) \[1518\]  
Back then I too was living in  
the Himalayas, as a sage,  
master of boundless magic power,  
in a delightful ashram \[there\]. (2) \[1519\]  
\[Flying\] like a bird in the sky,  
I felt drawn to a mountain\[-side\].  
Picking some flower\[s\] down below  
I \[then\] came \[up\] to the mountain. (3) \[1520\]  
Taking seven flowers I placed them  
on the top of \[Abhibhū’s\] head.  
When the hero \[then\] looked forward[^2]  
I departed facing the east. (4) \[1521\]  
Having arrived at \[my\] ashram  
I went up to my dwelling \[there\].  
Taking ascetics’ provisions  
I returned to that mountain\[-side\].[^3] (5) \[1522\]  
A python with a frightful form,  
\[and\] very strong, attacked me \[then\].  
Remembering my former deed  
I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (6) \[1523\]  
In the thirty-one aeons since  
I offered those flowers \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of flower-*pūjā*. (7) \[1524\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[1525\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Adhopupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Adhopupphiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Below-Flower-er”  
[^2]: lit., “when there was looking forward by the hero \[alt. wise
    one\],” i.e., “when he saw me”.  
[^3]: lit., “I entered into the mountain.”
