*\[308. Anulepadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
I saw \[a monk\], a follower,  
of Atthadassi \[Buddha\], Sage.  
I approached while he was doing  
repairs on the boundary \[there\]. (1) \[2755\]

When the repairs were completed,  
I donated ointment \[to him\],  
happy, \[my\] heart \[filled\] with pleasure  
in the unsurpassed merit-field. (2) \[2756\]

In the eighteen-hundred aeons  
\[since\] I did that \[good\] karma then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] ointment. (3) \[2757\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2758\]

Thus indeed Venerable Anulepadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Anulepadāyaka Thera is finished.
