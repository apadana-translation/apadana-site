### \[505. {508.}[^1] Amoraphaliya[^2]\]

I gave a fruit \[called\] *amora*[^3]  
to the Gold-Colored Sambuddha,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
who had entered onto the road. (1) \[5437\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that fruit at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (2) \[5438\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[5439\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[5440\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5441\]

Thus indeed Venerable Amoraphaliya[^4] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Amoraphaliya[^5] Thera is finished.

The same *apadāna* is presented below as \#509 {512} woth the slight difference that the name of the fruit in v. 1, and hence of the donor, is *kapittha*/*Kapitthaphaladāyaka* rather than *amora*/*Amoraphaliya*
