*\[361. {364.}*[^1] *Kesarapupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
I was a sorcerer[^3] \[back then,\]  
on a Himalayan mountain.  
I saw the Spotless One, Buddha,  
Great Famed One, walking back and forth. (1) \[3191\]

At that time I having placed[^4]  
three *kesara* flowers on \[my\] head,  
I approached \[him\], the Sambuddha,  
\[and\] did *pūjā* to Vessabhu. (2) \[3192\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[3193\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3194\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kesarapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kesarapupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “*Kesara-*Flower-er.” *Kesara* can refer to the *punnāga* tree (Sinh. *domba*) as well as the *mūnamal* or *muhuṇa mal* tree, Mimusops Elengi. The present poem gives no context for deciding which of the two is intended here; BJTS glosses the term as *domba-mal,* but I leave it untranslated as a result*.*

[^3]: *vijjādharo,* “spell-knower”

[^4]: lit “made”
