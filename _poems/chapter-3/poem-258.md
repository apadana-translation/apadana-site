*\[258. Paṇṇadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
On a Himalayan mountain,  
I was a bark-clothed \[ascetic\],  
subsisting on unsalted leaves,  
self-controlled in terms of my needs.[^2] (1) \[2526\]

When \[my\] breakfast had been obtained,  
Siddhattha \[Buddha\] approached me.  
I gave that \[food\] to the Buddha,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands. (2) \[2527\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] those leaves at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of leaf-donations. (3) \[2528\]

In the twenty-seventh aeon  
there was a king, Yadatthiya,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2529\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances;  
six special knowledges mastered:  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2530\]

Thus indeed Venerable Paṇṇadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Paṇṇadāyaka Thera is finished.
