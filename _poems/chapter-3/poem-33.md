### \[33. Mahā-Kaccāna[^1]\]

Covering it over with gold,  
I had a lion-throne fashioned  
\[at\] the shrine known as “Paduma”  
of the Lord Padumuttara. (1) \[1033\]

Taking an umbrella of gems  
and a fan made out of ox-tail,  
I placed them \[there\] for that Buddha,  
the World’s Kinsman, the Neutral One. (2) \[1034\]

Throughout the earth the lesser gods  
all gathered together \[there\] then.  
“He’ll relate the karmic results  
of umbrellas and seats[^2] of gems. (3) \[1035\]

We will listen to all \[that’s said\]  
when the Teacher is speaking \[thus\].  
We will produce great happiness  
in the Buddha’s dispensation.[^3]” (4) \[1036\]

Sitting down on the throne of gold,  
the Self-Become One, Top Person,  
encompassed by the Assembly[^4]  
\[then\] spoke these verses \[about me\]: (5) \[1037\]

“I shall relate details of him  
who has given this throne \[to me\],  
made of gold and \[also of\] gems;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (6) \[1038\]

For thirty aeons, king of gods,  
he will exercise divine rule.  
A hundred leagues surrounding \[him\]  
he will conquer with \[his bright\] light. (7) \[1039\]

Having come to the human world  
he will be a wheel-turning king.  
His name will be Pabhassara[^5]  
\[and he will possess\] great power. (8) \[1040\]

Like the risen hundred-rayed \[sun\],  
whether it is day or it’s night,  
that Kṣatriyan will shine forth \[there\]  
eight cubits all around \[himself\]. (9) \[1041\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (10) \[1042\]

Falling from Tusitā heaven,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
he’ll be \[born as\] Brahma’s kinsman;  
his name \[will then be\] Kaccāna. (11) \[1043\]

After he renounces \[the world,\]  
he’ll be an arahant, undefiled.  
Gotama, the Lamp of the World  
will place him in a foremost place. (12) \[1044\]

He’ll explicate in great detail  
the problems that are posed in brief.  
Explicating \[thus\] that problem  
he will fulfill \[all their\] desires.” (13) \[1045\]

Being born in a wealthy clan,  
a brahmin master of mantras,  
giving up \[my\] wealth and grain I  
\[then\] went forth into homelessness. (14) \[1046\]

I explicate in great detail  
\[the problems\] posed only in brief.  
Fulfilling all of their desires  
I satisfy the Best Biped. (15) \[1047\]

Satisfied by me, the Hero,  
the Self-Become One, Top Person,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly  
did place me in that foremost place. (16) \[1048\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (17) \[1049\]

Thus indeed Venerable Mahākaccāna Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Mahākaccāna Thera is finshed.

[^1]: “Great Golden One,” a historical monk, and famous follower of the Buddha’s. See DPPN II:468ff., also cf. \#528 {531}, below, which is also ascribed to this monk.

[^2]: BJTS omits *āsana* (“seats”) from the compound, reading *ratanāmayachattānaṃ*, “of umbrellas made of gems”.

[^3]: *sammāsambuddhasāsane*, lit., “in the Supreme (or Great Perfected) Buddha’s dispensation”

[^4]: lit., “by the monks’ Assembly”

[^5]: “Pithy Light”
