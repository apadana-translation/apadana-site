### \[243. Naḷinakesariya[^1]\]

I was a water bird[^2] who dwelled  
within a natural lake[^3] \[there\].  
Then I saw \[him\], the God of Gods,  
\[when\] he was flying[^4] through the sky. (1) \[2470\]

With a mind that was very clear  
I plucked some pollen[^5] with my beak  
\[and then\] offered it to Tissa,  
the Buddha, Kinsman of the World. (2) \[2471\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2472\]

In the seventy-third aeon  
I was \[one\] named Satapatta,[^6]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2473\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2474\]

Thus indeed Venerable Naḷinakesariya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Naḷinakesariya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Lotus-Lake-er”

[^2]: *jalakukkuṭa* = water-fowl, a duck or something similar.

[^3]: This follows the BJTS gloss, which follows the cty. lit., “living in the center of a self-produced lake”

[^4]: lit., “going”

[^5]: *kesariŋ* = flower pollen (or filaments, “hairs”). BJTS understands this to be the pollen of a lotus blossom growing on the lake.

[^6]: “Lotus Flower”
