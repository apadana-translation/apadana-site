### \[79. Ṭhitañjaliya[^1]\]

In the past, in a forest grove,  
I was a man who hunted deer.  
There I saw Sambuddha Tissa  
bearing the marks of a Great Man.[^2] (1) \[1464\]

Pressing hands together for him,[^3]  
sitting down in that neighborhood  
on a leaf-mat that was placed \[there\],  
I then set off facing the east. (2) \[1465\]

Just then a fallen lightening bolt  
landed on the top of my head.  
Again, as I lay there dying,[^4]  
I pressed both my hands together. (3) \[1466\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I pressed my hands together \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of pressing my hands. (4) \[1467\]

Four and fifty aeons \[ago\]  
the \[monarch\] named Migaketu[^5]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[1468\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1469\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ṭhitañjaliya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ṭhitañjaliya Thera is finished.
