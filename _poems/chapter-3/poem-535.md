*\[532. {535.}*[^1] *Kumāra-Kassapa*[^2]*\]*  
One hundred thousand aeons hence  
the Leader arose \[in the world\],  
the Hero, Friend of Every World,[^3]  
who name was Padumuttara. (1) \[5811\]

Being a brahmin at that time,  
distinguished,[^4] a Vedic master,  
wandering during siesta,  
I saw the Leader of the World,  
explaining the Four \[Noble\] Truths,  
awakening the world with gods,  
praising in the multitude the  
top of those with varied discourse. (2-3) \[5812-5813\]  
At that time, with a gladdened heart,  
inviting \[him\], the Thus-Gone-One,  
decorating a pavilion  
with \[bolts\] of cloth diversely dyed,  
lit up by various gemstones,  
I fed \[him\] with the monks[^5] \[in it\].  
Having fed \[them all\] for a week  
diverse, foremost \[and\] tasty food,  
worshipping[^6] \[him\] and followers  
with flowers of various hues,  
falling down in front of \[his\] feet,  
I aspired \[to attain\] that place. (4-6) \[5814-5816\]  
Then the Excellent Sage,[^7] Sole Hoard  
of the Taste of Compassion,[^8] said:  
“Look at that excellent brahmin,  
\[with\] face and eyes \[like\] lotuses,  
possessing much joy and delight,  
\[his\] body hair growing upward,  
\[his\] large eyes extremely mirthful,  
greedy for my dispensation,  
fallen down in front of my feet,  
happily turned toward one \[purpose:\][^9]  
he’s wishing for that \[foremost\] place  
\[of preachers with\] varied discourse.[^10] (7-9) \[5617-5819\]  
In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (10) \[5820\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
named Kumāra-Kassapa, he  
will be the Teacher’s follower. (11) \[5821\]

Through the power of that cloth with  
varied flowers and gems \[as well\],  
he will attain the foremost \[place\]  
of \[preachers\] with varied discourse.” (12) \[5822\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (13) \[5823\]

Touring[^11] the space of existence  
like an actor upon the stage,[^12]  
the son of a deer \[named\] Sākhā,[^13]  
I entered the womb of a doe. (14) \[5824\]

\[And\] then while I was in the womb,  
\[my mother’s\] turn to die stood nigh.[^14]  
Turned out[^15] by Sākhā, my mother  
went to Nigrodha for refuge. (15) \[5825\]

By that deer-king \[Nigrodha\], she  
was released from \[her pending\] death.  
Sacrificing his life \[instead\],  
\[Nigrodha\] then advised me thus: (16) \[5826\]

“Only Nigrodha should be served;  
don’t keep company with Sākhā.[^16]  
Better death in Nirodha\[‘s care\]  
than life in \[the care of\] Sākhā.” (17) \[5827\]

Instructed by that advice of the deer\[-king\],  
my mother and I, because of his advice,  
to the delightful Tusitā heaven came[^17]  
as though \[we\] had gone abroad, taking \[our\] house. (18-19)
\[5828\][^18]  
Again, when Hero Kassapa’s  
dispensation had reached \[its\] goal,  
ascending to a mountain-top  
engaged in the Victor’s teachings,[^19] (20) \[5829\]

now, in Rājagaha[^20] \[city\],  
I was born in a wealthy[^21] clan.  
My mother, with \[me in her\] womb,  
had gone[^22] forth into homelessness. (21) \[5830\]

Finding out that \[she\] was pregnant,  
they approached Devadatta[^23] then.  
He said, “let all of you banish[^24]  
this Buddhist nun[^25] who is evil.” (22) \[5831\]

Now \[she\] too being shown mercy  
by the Lord of Sages,[^26] Victor,  
my mother’s \[living\] happily  
in a convent for Buddhist nuns. (23) \[5832\]

Finding that out, the Kosala  
earth-protector supported me,  
with the care given to a prince,[^27]  
and by name I was “Kassapa.” (24) \[5833\]

Because there was “Great Kassapa,”  
I \[was known as\] “Boy Kassapa.”  
Hearing Buddha’s preaching that the  
body’s the same as an anthill,[^28]  
because of that my mind was freed  
from attachment altogether.  
After taming King Pāyāsi,[^29]  
I \[then\] attained that foremost place. (25-26) \[5834-5835\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (27) \[5836\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (28) \[5837\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (29) \[5838\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kumāra-Kassapa Thera is finished.
