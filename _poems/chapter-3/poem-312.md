### \[312. Bhojanadāyaka[^1]\]

Of good birth like a *sal* tree’s[^2] bough,  
rising up like a drumstick tree,[^3]  
\[streaking\] the sky like Indra’s bolt,[^4]  
the Victor was always shining. (1) \[2771\]

With a mind that was very clear,  
I donated edibles to  
him, the God Over Other Gods,  
Vessabhu \[Buddha\], the Great Sage. (2) \[2772\]

The Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
the Buddha, gave me thanks[^5] for that:  
“let it be born as fruit for you,  
as \[you’re\] reborn in existence.”[^6] (3) \[2773\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave that gift \[to him\] back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of \[giving\] food. (4) \[2774\]

In the twenty-five aeon hence  
there was one man, Amittabhā,[^7]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[2775\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2776\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bhojanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bhojanadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Food Donor”

[^2]: = *sāla*, *shorea robusta*

[^3]: *sobhañjana*. RD (sole <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>itation J v. 405) says Hyperanthica moringa, but that designation seems to be known only here and in <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>itations of this dictionary. The proper designation of the tree (Sinh. *murunga*) is *Moringaceae moringa* (it is the only genus of that larger family, with thirteen species indigenous to Africa and Asia). English “Drumstick Tree” “Horseradish tree” (due to horseradish-like flavor of the roots,) “Benzoil Tree” for an oil extracted from its seeds, produces clusters of fragrant pale yellowish flowers followed by a long seedpod which is eaten as a vegetable across the Indian world (in which it grows easily; broken branches will bear fruit within a year of replanting, and it grows for the light, tall and lanky, such that it’s demise is often the result of its size, whether through breaking off or becoming a nuisance)

[^4]: *indalaṭṭhi*, i.e., lightening (or the rainbow, in which case translating “\[painting\] the sky like Inda’s bow” would preserve the play in the original, which parallels this simile with the comparison to the *sal* branch or sprout \[also *°laṭṭhi*\] in the first line). Cone has an entry on *indalaṭṭhi*, based on Ap witness alone, which similarly leaves the ambiguity between rainbow and lightening unresolved.

[^5]: *anumodi*

[^6]: lit., “in existence,” in the cycle of reincarnation, *bhave*

[^7]: ”Light for the Friendless”
