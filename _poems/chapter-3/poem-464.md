*\[461. {464.}*[^1] *Setudāyaka*[^2]*\]*

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,

I had a causeway constructed,

near the \[meditation\] walkway

of Vipassi, the Blessed One. (1) \[4879\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I had that causeway made \[back then\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of a causeway. (2) \[4880\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (3) \[4881\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4882\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4883\]

Thus indeed Venerable Setudāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Setudāyaka Thera is finished.
