*\[75. Ekasaññaka*[^1]*\]*  
Vipassi’s chief follower was  
\[the arahant who was\] named Khaṇḍa  
who got the world’s sacrifices;  
I gave one alms-meal \[to him then\]. (1) \[1440\]  
Due to that pleasure in \[my\] heart  
for the Biped-Lord, Bull of Men,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of one alms-meal. (2) \[1441\]  
In the fortieth aeon ago  
the Kṣatriyan named Varuṇa  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[1442\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[1443\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Ekasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ekasaññaka Thera is finished.
