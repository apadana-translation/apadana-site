### \[456. {459.}[^1] Paṭṭipupphiya[^2]\]

When the relics were carried off,  
when the drums were being beaten,  
happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I offered[^3] a red lodh[^4] flower. (1) \[4854\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I offered[^5] that flower \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of relic-worship.[^6] (2) \[4855\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4856\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4857\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4858\]

Thus indeed Venerable Paṭṭipupphiya[^7] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Paṭṭipupphiya[^8] Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Red Lodh Flower-er.” This is the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reading for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *Sattipaṇṇiya*, “Satti-Leaf-er”. I do not find *satti* in the dictionaries as the name of a type of flower. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> chapter summary confirms its reading, but so does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> summary (see below), leaving the correct reading something of a mystery. I take the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reading here because at least it has a meaning.

[^3]: lit., “did *pūjā*”

[^4]: *paṭṭipuppham*, Sinh. *rat lot* or *ratu lot gasa*, Engl. red lodh tree, the bark of which is used in dying. <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reads *sattipuppham* (“a *satti* flower”)

[^5]: lit., “did *pūjā*”

[^6]: lit., “doing *pūjā* to the body”

[^7]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reads *Sattipaṇṇiyo°*

[^8]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reads *Sattipaṇṇiyo°*
