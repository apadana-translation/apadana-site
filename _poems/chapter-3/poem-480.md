*\[477. {480.}*[^1] *Pulinacaṅkamiya*[^2]*\]*  
In the past, in a forest grove,  
I was a man who hunted deer.  
Searching after a *vāta-*deer,[^3]  
I saw \[the Buddha’s\] walkway \[there\]. (1) \[5025\]  
Happy, with pleasure in my heart,  
taking sand in \[my\] lap-pocket,  
I sprinkled \[it\] on the walkway  
of the Well-Gone One, Splendid One.[^4] (2) \[5026\]  
In the thirty-one aeons since  
I sprinkled that sand \[at that time\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of \[giving\] sand. (3) \[5027\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5028\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5029\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5030\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Pulinacaṅkamiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pulinacaṅkamiya Thera is finished.  
The Summary:  
Naḷamālī, Maṇidada,  
Ukkāsatika, Vījanī,  
Kummāsa and Kusaṭṭha \[too\],  
also Giripunnāgiya,  
Vallikāra,[^5] Pānadhida  
\[and\] then Pulīnacaṅkama:  
five and ninety are the verses  
that are counted by those who know.
