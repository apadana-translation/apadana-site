*\[150. Pallaṅkadāyaka*[^1]*\]*

I gave Sumedha, the World’s Best,

the Blessed One, the Neutral One,

a \[well-made\] couch \[for him to use,\]

which had an upper covering. (1) \[1988\]

At that time that \[well-made\] couch was

studded with the seven gemstones.

In accordance with my thinking,

\[that is\] always produced for me.[^2] (2) \[1989\]

In the thirty thousand aeons

since I gave \[him\] that couch back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of a couch-\[gift\]. (3) \[1990\]

In the twenty-thousandth aeon,

there were three \[named\] Suvaṇṇābha,[^3]

wheel-turning kings with great power,

possessors of the seven gems. (4) \[1991\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1992\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pallaṅkadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pallaṅkadāyaka Thera is finished.
