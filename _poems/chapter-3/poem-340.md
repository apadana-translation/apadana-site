*\[337. {340.}*[^1] *Ukkhittapadumiya*[^2]*\]*  
In the city, Haṃsavatī,  
I was a florist at that time.  
Plunging into a lotus lake,  
I gathered \[some\] lotus blossoms. (1) \[3060\]

The Victor Padumuttara  
was the Master of Everything.[^3]  
Along with one hundred thousand  
such-like ones whose minds were peaceful,  
pure ones with defilements destroyed,  
six special knowledge-possessors,  
the Ultimate Person approached  
desirous of my improvement.[^4] (2-3) \[3061-3062\]  
Having seen \[him\], the God of Gods,  
the Self-Become One, World-Leader,  
breaking off the stems I tossed \[those\]  
lotuses into the air then. (4) \[3063\]

“If you are a Buddha, Hero,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
let \[these\] lotuses by themselves  
go \[and\] be carried on your head.” (5) \[3064\]

The World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
the Great Hero then wishing so,  
through the power[^5] of the Buddha,  
those \[blooms\] were carried on his head. (6) \[3065\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (7) \[3066\]

There my well-constructed mansion  
was known as[^6] “One Hundred Petals.”[^7]  
It rose up sixty leagues \[in height\];  
\[and it\] was thirty leagues in width. (8) \[3067\]

A thousand times the lord of gods,  
I exercised divine rule \[then\].  
And seventy-five times I was  
a king who turned the wheel \[of law\]. (9) \[3068\]

There was \[also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting.  
I experienced own-karma,  
formerly well done by myself. (10) \[3069\]

Due to just that single lotus,  
experiencing good fortune,  
I realized the Teaching of  
the Blessed \[Buddha\], Gotama. (11) \[3070\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (12) \[3071\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I offered \[him\][^8] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of a single lotus*.* (13) \[3072\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[3073\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ukkhittapadumiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ukkhittapadumiya Thera is finished.
