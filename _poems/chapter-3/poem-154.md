### \[154. Kakkārupūjaka[^1]\]

Having been the son of a god,  
I worshipped[^2] Sikhi, the Leader.  
Taking a *kakkāru* flower  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha. (1) \[2013\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I offered that flower \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (2) \[2014\]

And in the ninth aeon ago  
I was the king, Sattuttama,[^3]  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2015\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2016\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kakkārupūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kakkārupūjaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “*Kakkāru-*Flower Donor.” *Kakkāru* is a type of celestial flower.

[^2]: lit., “did *pūjā* for”.

[^3]: “Best of Beings”
