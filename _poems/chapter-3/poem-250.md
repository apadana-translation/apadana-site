### \[250. Uddāladāyaka[^1]\]

The \[Buddha\] named Kakusandha[^2]  
the Self-Become One, Unconquered,  
coming out from the great forest  
had arrived at a big river. (1) \[2495\]

Taking a golden shower[^3] \[bloom\],  
having a mind \[full of\] pleasure,  
I gave \[it\] to the Self-Become,  
Self-Controlled One, the Honest One.[^4] (2) \[2496\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of flower-*pūjā*. (3) \[2497\]

The four analytical modes  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered:  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2498\]

Thus indeed Venerable Uddāladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Uddāladāyaka Thera is finished.

The Summary:

Tuvara, Nāga, Nalinā,  
Virava, Kuṭidhūpaka,  
Patta, Dhātu, Pāṭaliya,  
\[and\] Bimbi; with Uddālaka  
thirty-seven verses counted  
by those ones who know the meaning.
