*\[425. {428.}*[^1] *Sucintita*[^2]*\]*  
In the city, Haṃsavatī,  
I was a cultivator then.  
I \[earn my\] living by farming,  
\[and\] through it I feed \[my\] children. (1) \[4567\]

\[My\] field back then was bountiful,  
\[and\] my grain was producing seed;[^3]  
when the fruit-bearing time arrived,  
I then thought \[about it\] like this: (2) \[4568\]

“It’s not right, it is not fitting  
for one who knows what’s virtuous,[^4]  
that without giving to the monks,[^5]  
I should consume the best of this. (3) \[4569\]

This Buddha’s the Impartial One,[^6]  
Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks;  
reared[^7] by him, the monks’ Assembly  
is the unsurpassed merit-field. (4) \[4570\]

I shall give a donation there,  
the first of each of the new crop.”[^8]  
Thinking about \[it\] like that, I  
was happy, with a gladdened mind.[^9] (5) \[4571\]

\[Then\] carrying grain from \[my\] field,  
I went up to the Sambuddha.  
Having approached the Sambuddha,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
\[and\] worshipping the Teacher’s feet,  
I spoke these words \[to the Buddha\]: (6) \[4572\][^10]  
“The new crop \[of grain\] has prospered;  
you’re[^11] the Recipient of Gifts.[^12]  
O Sage, showing \[me\] compassion,  
please accept it, O Eyeful One.”[^13] (7) \[4573\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
discerning what I was thinking,  
spoke these words \[to me at that time\]: (8) \[4574\]

“Four have entered \[into the path\];  
four are established in \[its\] fruit.[^14]  
This monks’ Assembly is upright,  
settled in wisdom \[and\] morals. (9) \[4575\]

Merit done for the \[good\] rebirths  
of people doing rituals,[^15]  
beings looking \[to earn\] merit,  
gifted for the monks,[^16] bears great fruit. (10) \[4576\]

The new crop, so too more than that,  
is to be given to these monks.[^17]  
Proposing \[it\], lead monks from the  
Assembly to that house \[of yours\].  
What has been prepared in your house,  
give that to the monks’ Assembly.” (11) \[4577\][^18]  
Proposing \[it\], leading monks, from the  
Assembly to that house \[of mine\],  
what had been prepared in my house,  
I gave to the monks’ Assembly. (12) \[4578\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (13) \[4579\]

There my well-constructed mansion  
was \[made of\] gold, brightly shining.  
It rose up sixty leagues \[in height,\]  
\[and it\] was thirty leagues in width. (14) \[4580\]

The nineteenth recitation portion.  
That palace of mine was crowded,  
filled with \[varied\] groups of women.  
Eating and \[also\] drinking there,  
I live among the thirty gods.[^19] (15) \[4581\]

And three times in succession I  
exercised divine rule \[back then\],  
and five times in succession I  
was a monarch who turns the wheel,  
\[and I enjoyed\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (16) \[4582\][^20]  
Transmigrating from birth to birth,  
I receive unlimited wealth.  
I have no lack of possessions:  
that is the fruit of a new crop. (17) \[4583\]

Elephant- \[and\] horse-vehicles,  
palanquins, also chariots --  
I am obtaining all of them:  
that is the fruit of a new crop. (18) \[4584\]

New clothing \[and likewise\] new fruit,  
new food which has the best flavor --  
I am obtaining all of them:  
that is the fruit of a new crop. (19) \[4585\]

Silk cloth[^21] and woolen blankets[^22] too,  
*khoma* and also cotton cloth[^23] --  
I am obtaining all of them:  
that is the fruit of a new crop. (20) \[4586\]

Groups of slave-women, groups of slaves,  
and women who are all decked out --  
I am obtaining all of them:  
that is the fruit of a new crop. (21) \[4587\]

I am not cold, I am not hot;  
burning fever does not exist.  
And also mental suffering[^24]  
is non-existent in my mind. (22) \[4588\]

\[People say,\] “Eat this,” “enjoy this,”  
“lit down \[to sleep\] in this \[good\] bed.”  
I am obtaining all of that:  
that is the fruit of a new crop. (23) \[4589\]

Now is the final time for me;  
\[my\] last rebirth is proceeding.[^25]  
Today the fruit which I donated[^26]  
is always making \[me\] happy. (24) \[4590\]

After donating \[my\] new crop,  
for the monks of splendid virtue,[^27]  
I experience eight results,[^28]  
in accordance with my karma. (25) \[4591\]

I’m handsome and I’m famous \[too\],  
very wealthy[^29] and free from harm;  
always in the majority,[^30]  
my retinue has no factions.  
They all are giving me respect,  
whomever on earth I mix with.  
And whatever gifts[^31] there \[may\] be,  
I \[always\] get the first of each.[^32] (26-27) \[4592-4593\]  
In the middle of the monks[^33] or  
face-to-face with the Best Buddha,  
passing over all the \[others\],  
the donors are giving to me. (28) \[4594\]

Having given the first new crop,  
for the monks of splendid virtue,[^34]  
I am enjoying these results:  
that is the fruit of a new crop. (29) \[4595\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave that donation then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of a new crop. (30) \[4596\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (31) \[4597\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (32) \[4598\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (33) \[4599\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sucintita Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sucintita Thera is finished.
