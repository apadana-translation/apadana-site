*\[194. Asokapūjaka*[^1]*\]*  
In lovely Tivarā City,  
there was a royal garden then.  
I was a royal attendant,[^2]  
the warden of the garden there. (1) \[2230\]

The Self-Become One, Full of Light,[^3]  
named Paduma was \[Buddha then\].  
Sitting in a lotus’ shade  
that Sage had not \[yet\] left \[the world\].[^4] (2) \[2231\]

Seeing an ashoka[^5] in bloom  
heavy with clusters, beautiful,  
I gave a bloom to the Buddha,  
the excellent-lotus-named Sage. (3) \[2232\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I offered that flower \[to him,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[2233\]

In the seventieth aeon  
were sixteen Aruṇañjahas,[^6]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength,  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[2234\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2235\]

Thus indeed Venerable Asokapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Asokapūjaka Thera is finished.
