*\[63. Paccāgamanīya*[^1]*\]*  
I was a ruddy goose back then  
along the Indus River’s bank,  
subsisting \[only\] on white moss,  
\[and\] well-restrained in terms of sins. (1) \[1361\]

I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
traveling across the sky \[there\].  
Taking a *sal* blossom with my beak  
I honored \[Buddha\] Vipassi. (2) \[1362\]

He with faith in the Thus-Gone-One,  
unshaking \[and\] well-established,  
through \[feeling\] pleasure in \[his\] heart  
will not go on to bad rebirth.[^2] (3) \[1363\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
Good seeds have been planted by me  
when I was a bird \[way back then\]. (4) \[1364\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I presented \[him\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (5) \[1365\]

There were eight men who had one name  
which was Sucarudassana.[^3]  
They were wheel-turners with great strength  
\[full\] seventeen aeons ago. (6) \[1366\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1367\]

Thus indeed Venerable Paccāgamanīya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Paccāgamanīya Thera is finished.
