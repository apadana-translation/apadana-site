*\[274. Abbhañjanadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
Unguent was given by me  
to Koṇḍañña, the Blessed One,  
Free of Passion, the Neutral One,  
Whose Mind was as \[Wide\] as the Sky,  
Non-Delayed One,[^2] Meditator,[^3]  
Turner-back of All Delusion,  
the Well-Wisher of Every World,[^4]  
the Biped Lord, Neutral One. (1-2) \[2595-2596\]  
During aeons beyond measure  
since I gave \[Buddha\] unguent,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of \[giving\] unguent. (3) \[2597\]  
In the fifteenth aeon ago  
there was a ruler, Cirappa,[^5]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2598\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2599\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Abbhañjanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Abbhañjanadāyaka Thera is finished.
