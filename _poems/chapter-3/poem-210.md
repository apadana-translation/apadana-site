*\[210. Vātātapanivāriya*[^1]*\]*  
With a mind \[which was\] very clear,  
I gave a single umbrella  
to the Blessed One \[named\] Tissa,  
the God of Gods, the Neutral One. (1) \[2313\]  
The badness[^2] in me is suppressed;  
there is achievement of goodness.[^3]  
Umbrella carried in the sky:[^4]  
the fruit of previous karma. (2) \[2314\]  
\[This is\] my last transmigration,  
all existences are canceled.  
I \[now\] possess my last body  
in the Buddha’s[^5] dispensation. (3) \[2315\]  
In the ninety-two aeons since  
I gave that umbrella back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of umbrella-gifts. (4) \[2316\]  
The seventy-second aeon hence  
there were eight lords of the people,  
\[all\] known as Mahānidāna,[^6]  
kings who were wheel-turning monarchs. (5) \[2317\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2318\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Vātātapanivāriya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Vātātapanivāriya Thera is finished.
