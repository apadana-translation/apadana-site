*\[130. Padumapūjaka*[^1]*\]*  
In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named Gotama.  
It’s covered with various trees,  
and the lair of a great group of ghosts. (1) \[1862\]

In the middle of that \[mountain\]  
an ashram had been constructed.  
Surrounded by \[my own\] students,  
I lived in that ashram \[back then\]. (2) \[1863\]

“Let the student-group come to me;  
let them bring me a pink lotus;  
let us do a Buddha-*pūjā*  
for the Biped-Lord, Neutral One.” (3) \[1864\]

Having assented, “yes, \[sir, let’s\]”  
they brought a pink lotus \[flower\].  
Making an occasion for it,  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha. (4) \[1865\]

Then, assembling the students,  
I \[thus\] advised them thoroughly:  
“Don’t you \[ever\] be neglectful;  
\[be\] diligent, bring happiness.” (5) \[1866\]

Having thus advised those students  
who were patient about my words,[^2]  
\[and\] bound to diligent virtue,  
I passed away \[there\] at that time. (6) \[1867\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I offered \[that\] flower \[to him,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (7) \[1868\]

In the fifty-first aeon \[hence\]  
there was a king, Jaluttama,  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (8) \[1869\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9)  
Thus indeed Venerable Padumapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Padumapūjaka Thera is finished.

Five more than a hundred verses

[^2]: the BJTS Snhala gloss reads this phrase to mean that they were
    obedient (*kī karu*, i.e., did what they were told).
