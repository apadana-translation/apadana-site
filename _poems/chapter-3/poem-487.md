*\[484. {487.}*[^1] *Puḷinuppādaka*[^2]*\]*  
On a Himalayan mountain,  
\[I’m\] Devala the ascetic.  
My meditation walkway there  
was made by non-human beings.[^3] (1) \[5140\]  
Bearing a weight of matted hair,  
carrying a water-pot then,  
searching for ultimate meaning,  
I departed from the forest. (2) \[5141\]  
Eighty-six thousand students \[there,\]  
waited upon me at that time.  
Well-known together with their deeds,[^4]  
they are living in the forest. (3) \[5142\]  
Going out from the hermitage,  
I made a stupa out of sand.  
Assembling various flowers,  
I worshipped[^5] that stupa then. (4) \[5143\]  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart there,  
I \[re-\]entered the hermitage.  
All \[my\] students, come together,  
questioned me \[about\] what that meant:[^6] (5) \[5144\]  
“\[All of\] us would like to find out  
which deity you’re honoring  
\[at that\] stupa made out of sand:  
being asked, please tell \[that\] to us.”[^7] (6) \[5145\]  
“The Eyeful Ones, Greatly Famed Ones,  
have no views[^8] \[and\] no magic spells;[^9]  
they’re the ones I am honoring,  
the Best Buddhas, Greatly Famed Ones.” (7) \[5146\]  
“In what way are they Great Heroes,  
Omniscient Ones, Lords of the World?  
What do they look like?[^10] What conduct?  
In what way are they Greatly Famed?” (8) \[5147\]  
“Buddhas have thirty-two great marks,  
and also forty \[adult\] teeth.[^11]  
Their eyes with heifer-eyelashes[^12]  
resemble wild licorice fruits.[^13] (9) \[5148\]  
And when those Buddhas are walking,[^14]  
they look but a plough’s length ahead.[^15]  
They do not have a person’s voice;[^16]  
their euphonic sound[^17] is not heard. (10) \[5149\]  
Also, when those Well-Gone-Ones walk,  
they lift up \[one foot at a time\],[^18]  
\[always\] starting \[with\] the right foot:  
that is the nature of Buddhas. (11) \[5150\]  
And those Buddhas are not afraid,  
\[just\] like lions, the kings of beasts.  
They do not \[ever\] praise themselves,  
and don’t revile living beings. (12) \[5151\]  
They are free of pride and contempt,  
the same for all living beings.  
Buddhas \[only\] praise selflessly:  
that is the nature of Buddhas. (13) \[5152\]  
And \[when\] Buddhas are being born,  
they radiate light \[from themselves\],  
\[and\] in six \[different\] ways[^19] they cause  
this whole \[bountiful\] earth to quake. (14) \[5153\]  
And they are \[able to\] see hell,  
and hell is cooled off at that time.  
A massive cloud rains forth \[as well\]:  
that is the nature of Buddhas. (15) \[5154\]  
Such-like are those Great Elephants,  
Incomparable,[^20] of Great Fame;  
in beauty they are unsurpassed,[^21]  
the Thus-Gone-Ones, Beyond Measure.” (16) \[5155\]  
All of \[my\] students, respectful,  
\[then\] expressed \[their\] thanks for my speech,  
and[^22] likewise went along \[with me,\]  
as far as they could \[and\] had strength. (17) \[5156\]  
Wishing for \[their\] own \[good\] karma,  
they’re worshipping \[that\] sand \[stupa\].  
Having faith in that speech \[of mine\],  
their minds drifted[^23] to Buddhahood. (18) \[5157\]  
Then a God’s Son, Greatly Famous,  
fell down from Tusitā heaven.  
He was born in a mother’s womb,  
making the ten-thousand \[worlds\] quake. (19) \[5158\]  
I stood on the walkway which was  
near \[my\] hermitage \[at that time\].  
All \[my\] students, having gathered,  
came into my presence \[just then\]. (20) \[5159\]  
“The earth, bull-like, is bellowing;  
it’s roaring like the king of beasts.  
It’s shaking[^24] like a crocodile;  
what will this be the result of?” (21) \[5160\]  
“The Buddha[^25] I detailed \[for you,\]  
close to the stupa made of sand,  
the Blessed One, the Teacher, now  
has been born in a mother’s womb.” (22) \[5161\]  
Discussing the Teaching for them,  
\[and\] having detailed the Great Sage,  
exhorting \[my\] own students \[there\],  
I sat in lotus position. (23) \[5162\]  
\[All\] my strength was \[then\] exhausted,  
due to a serious[^26] illness.  
Remembering the Best Buddha,  
I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (24) \[5163\]  
All \[of my\] students assembled;  
they made \[me\] a pyre at that time,  
and taking my mortal remains,[^27]  
they lifted \[me\] onto the pyre. (25) \[5164\]  
Having attended to the pyre,  
hands pressed together on \[their\] heads,  
wounded[^28] by the arrows of grief,  
come together they lamented. (26) \[5165\]  
While they were wailing \[uselessly,\][^29]  
I \[then\] came \[back\] to the pyre \[there\].  
“I am your \[dead\] teacher, wise ones;  
do not lament \[my passing on\]. (27) \[5166\]  
Endeavor for the highest good,  
night and day not being lazy.  
Don’t be negligent, all of you;  
your moment[^30] is offered to you.” (28) \[5167\]  
Exhorting \[my\] own students \[thus\],  
I returned to the world of gods.  
For eighteen aeons \[after that\]  
I delighted in the gods’ world. (29) \[5168\]  
And \[then\] a hundred times I was  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\].  
Also another hundred times,  
I was a king who turns the wheel.  
Also another hundred times  
I \[then\] exercised divine rule. (30) \[5169\][^31]  
In the remaining aeons I  
transmigrated as god or man.[^32]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of generating.[^33] (31) \[5170\]  
As in the month of Kattikā,[^34]  
many trees are in full flower,  
likewise in that very season,  
I have flowered as a great sage. (32) \[5171\]  
Vigorous effort’s the yoked ox,  
carrying perfect peace for me.[^35]  
Like elephants with broken chains  
I am dwelling without constraint. (33) \[5172\]  
In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I praised the Buddha \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of praising \[Buddhas\]. (34) \[5173\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (35) \[5174\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (36) \[5175\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (37) \[5176\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Puḷinuppādaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Puḷinuppādaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Sand-Generator”. BTS reads *Pulinº*  
[^3]: reading *amānussehi māpito* with BJTS for PTS **amānussikamāpito
    (roughly the same meaning: “non-human-made”)**

[^10]: or “what caste are they?,” *kathaŋ vaṇṇaº* (BJTS reads, more
    correctly, *kathaṃ vaṇṇā*)  
[^11]: *cattārīsa-ddijāpi ca* ((PTS), *ºdvijāpi ca* (BJTS), following
    BJTS Sinh. gloss in understanding *dvija* as “tooth” (“twice born,”
    hence the adult teeth).  
[^12]: reading *nettā gopa\[k\]khumā* with BJTS for PTS *gopamukhā*
    (“face to face with a cow”)  
[^13]: *jiñjukaphalasannibhā.* The *jiñjuka* (also known as *guñja* in
    Pāli) shrub, Sinh. *huninda* (BJTS gloss) or *olinda* is Abrus
    pracatorius (*Legum.*). It bears distinctive, small red or black
    berries which serve as the smallest jeweller’s weight and are used
    in a traditional Sri Lankan board game; the present epithet
    presumably refers to the (very) black berries borne by this plant.  
[^14]: lit., “going”  
[^15]: *yugamattañ ca pekkhare* lit., “looking ahead the extent of a
    plough,” i.e., just a little, keeping their eyes on the ground in
    front of them  
[^16]: lit., “there is not to them a person-speaking”  
[^17]: *sandhisaddo*  
[^18]: lit., “they go lifting up”  
[^19]: *chabbikāraŋ* (PTS), *chappakāraṃ* (BJTS)  
[^20]: *atulyā*  
[^21]: *vaṇṇato anatikkantā,* following BJTS Sinhala gloss: *rūpakāya
    sampattiyen no ikmavanu häkkō ya,* “it is not possible to surpass
    them in good fortune as regards \[their\] form-bodies.  
[^22]: reading *ca* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) fr PTS *va*  
[^23]: lit., “are gone”  
[^24]: reading *salati* with BJTS for PTS *saddati*  
[^25]: lit., “Sambuddha”  
[^26]: *paramena,* “superior” “best.” BJTS Sinhala gloss: *däḍi,*
    “strong”  
[^27]: *kalebaraŋ,* lit., “corpse” or “body”  
[^28]: *ºpareta*, lit., “overcome by” “afflicted with”  
[^29]: *tesaŋ lālappamānaŋ* (gen. abs. construction). *Lālappati* means
    “lament, wail” as well as “to talk too much,” “to talk silly,” the
    intensive of *lapati,* “to mutter, talk, prattle”. I have
    interpolated “\[uselessly\]” *metri causa,* but in doing so convey
    the connotation of the term (and the subsequent speech by the ghost
    of the teacher) that their wailing was excessive or pointless.  
[^30]: BJTS Sinh gloss: “the birth of a Buddha, which frees \[one\] from
    the eight evil moments \[Sinh dict. i.e., (1) birth in hell, (2)
    birth as an animal, (3) birth as a demon, (4) birth in the two
    Brahma worlds where neither body nor mind exists, (5) birth in a
    foreign country devoid of the Buddha’s Teaching, (6) birth with the
    five senses confused or perverted, (7) birth as a non-religious
    person, and (8) birth in a Buddha-less age\]”  
[^31]: PTS presents this as a six-footed verse, in an apparently
    mistaken (and redundant) repetition of the first two feet (a-b) as
    c-d. BJTS presents a standard four-footed verse, omitting PTS 30c-d
    (i.e., corresponding to PTS 30a-b and 30e-f).  
[^32]: *vokiṇṇo* (BJTS and PTS alt. reads *vokiṇṇaŋ*), lit., “mixed”. I
    follow BJTS in taking the term to refer to a mix of births as a god
    and births as a human.  
[^33]: *uppādassa.* The term (as too in the name ascribed to this monk)
    apparently refers to the “generating” (or “producing”) of the stupa
    made of sand.  
[^34]: the name of a lunar month, Skt. *Kṛttikā,* BSkt *Karthikā,* Sinh.
    *il,* corresponding to October-November
