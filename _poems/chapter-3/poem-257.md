### \[257. Mañjaripūjaka[^1]\]

Fashioning a bunch[^2] \[of flowers,\]  
I went out onto[^3] the highway.  
I saw the Monk, Bettered by None,  
Honored by the Monks’ Assembly. (1) \[2521\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
and \[filled\] with supreme joyfulness,  
taking \[it\] with both of my hands  
I offered Buddha \[that bouquet\]. (2) \[2522\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2523\]

In the seventy-third aeon  
there was one ruler of the earth,  
known by the name of Jotiya,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (4) \[2524\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2525\]

Thus indeed Venerable Mañjaripūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Mañjaripūjaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Offerer of a Bunch”

[^2]: *mañjari* is a bunch, cluster, stem with branches; the causative *karitvā* suggests human agency in constructing it, which suggests to me a grouping of flowers, i.e., a bouquet or perhaps a wreath or other ornament.

[^3]: lit., “entered into”

[^4]: fr. *joti*, “Star” or “Light” or “Splendour” or “Glory”
