*\[126. Kusumāsaniya*[^1]*\]*  
In the city, Dhaññavatī,  
I was a brahmin at that time,  
a master of the three Vedas,  
well-versed in marks and history,  
the dictionaries and poetry,[^2]  
\[also\] skilled in \[reading\] omens,  
an \[erudite\] grammarian;  
I taught mantras to my students. (1-2) \[1830-1831\]  
At that time I’d placed on the road[^3]  
five handfuls of lotus flowers,  
wishing to offer sacrifice  
for \[my\] mother and \[my\] father.[^4] (3) \[1832\]

The Blessed One then, Vipassi,  
Honored by the monks’ Assembly,  
the Bull of Men went \[near me then,\]  
lighting up every direction. (4) \[1833\]

Having invited the Great Sage,  
I appointed a seat \[for him,\]  
then spreading out those flowers \[there\],  
I led[^5] \[him\] up to \[my\] own house. (5) \[1834\]

Whatever I had in \[my\] house,  
alms-food which \[I\] had been given,  
I gave \[all\] that to the Buddha,  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[my\] own hands. (6) \[1835\]

Discerning when his meal was done,[^6]  
I gave one handful \[of flowers\].  
Giving thanks, the Omniscient One  
\[then\] departed facing the north. (7) \[1836\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that flower back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving flowers. (8) \[1837\]

In an intervening aeon,  
I was King Varadassana,[^7]  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (9) \[1838\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[1839\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kusumāsaniya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kusumāsaniya Thera is finished.
