### \[349. {352.}[^1] Yavakalāpiya[^2]\]

In Aruṇavatī City,  
I was a barley grower[^3] then.  
Seeing the Buddha[^4] on the road,  
I spread out a sheaf of barley. (1) \[3145\]

Sikhi, Chief Leader of the World,  
Merciful, Compassionate One,  
discerning what I was thinking,  
sat down on that sheaf of barley. (2) \[3146\]

Seeing the seated Spotless One,  
the Great Meditator, Leader,  
\[and\] generating great delight,  
I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (3) \[3147\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit in spreading out barley. (4) \[3148\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[3149\]

Thus indeed Venerable Yavakalāpiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Yavakalāpiya Thera is finished.
