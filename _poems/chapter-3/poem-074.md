### \[74. Bhisāluvadāyaka[^1]\]

Plunging into a forest grove,  
I was living in the jungle.  
I saw the Buddha, Vipassi,  
Sacrificial Recipient. (1) \[1435\]

I gave him edible roots,[^2] and  
water so he could wash \[his\] hand.  
Worshipping \[his\] feet with my head,  
I departed facing the north. (2) \[1436\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him those\] edible roots,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of good karma. (3) \[1437\]

In the third aeon \[after that\]  
there was a strong wheel-turning king,  
Kṣatriyan Bhisasammata,[^3]  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[1438\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1439\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bhisāluvadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bhisāluvadāyaka Thera is finished.
