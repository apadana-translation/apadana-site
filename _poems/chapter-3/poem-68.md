*\[68. Ambadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
Anomadassi, Blessed One,  
while sitting on a mountain did  
spread this endless world with loving-  
kindness, the One Without Desires. (1) \[1401\]

I was a monkey at that time  
in the supreme Himalayas.  
Having seen Anoma, Boundless,  
\[my\] heart was pleased in the Buddha. (2) \[1402\]

In the Himalayan region  
mango trees were bearing fruit then.  
Therefore, taking a mango fruit  
I gave it, with a honey-comb. (3) \[1403\]

Anomadassi, the Great Sage,  
Buddha prophesied this to me:  
“because of both this honey-gift  
and \[too\] this gift of mango \[fruit,\] (4) \[1404\]

you’ll delight in the world of gods  
for fifty-seven aeons \[hence\].  
You will transmigrate in a mix[^2]  
for \[all\] the remaining aeons. (5) \[1405\]

Having cast off evil karma  
\[and\] with mature intelligence,  
departing from \[this\] place of grief  
you will destroy \[your\] defilements.” (6) \[1406\]

I’ve been tamed by the Sage So Great  
by means of the superb taming.[^3]  
I’ve attained the unshaking state  
beyond \[all\] conquest and defeat. (7) \[1407\]

Seventy-seven aeons \[hence\][^4]  
there were fourteen \[different\] kings \[then\]  
\[who were all\] named Ambaṭṭhaja[^5]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (8) \[1408\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1409\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ambadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ambadāyaka Thera is finished.
