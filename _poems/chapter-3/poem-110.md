*\[110. Reṇupūjaka*[^1]*\]*  
\[I saw\] the golden Sambuddha,  
just like the hundred-raying sun,  
shining forth in all directions  
just like the moon when it is full, (1) \[1672\]

surrounded by \[his followers\]  
just like the earth is by the sea.  
I presented to Vipassi  
a pollen-filled ironwood[^2] bloom. (2) \[1673\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I offered that pollen \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[1674\]

In the forty-fifth aeon hence  
there was a king[^3] known as Reṇu,[^4]  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[1675\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1676\]

Thus indeed Venerable Reṇupūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Reṇupūjaka Thera is finished.
