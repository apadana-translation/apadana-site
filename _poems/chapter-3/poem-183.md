### \[183. Koṭumbariya[^1]\]

Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I approached the Best among Men,  
shining like a dinner-plate tree,[^2]  
sitting down amidst the mountains,  
like the ocean without measure,  
extending[^3] as far as the earth,  
worshipped[^4] by the gods’ assembly,[^5]  
of the best race of bulls of men. (1-2) \[2163-2164\]

I \[once\] offered to the Buddha  
Sikhi, the Kinsman of the World,  
a piece of cloth[^6] \[which I had\] filled  
with seven flowers \[I\] had plucked. (3) \[2165\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (4) \[2166\]

In the twentieth aeon hence  
I was a greatly powerful  
wheel-turning monarch with great strength,  
\[known by the\] name Mahāṇela.[^7] (5) \[2167\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2168\]

Thus indeed Venerable Koṭumbariya[^8] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Koṭumbariya[^9] Thera is finished.
