*Kaṇikārapupphiya Chapter, the Twenty-First*  
*\[201. Kaṇikārapupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
Seeing a dinner-plate[^2] in bloom,  
and having plucked it at that time,  
I \[then\] offered \[it\] to Tissa,  
the Flood-Crosser, the Neutral One. (1) \[2271\]  
In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (2) \[2272\]  
In the thirty-fifth aeon hence  
\[lived\] well-known Aruṇapāla,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2273\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2274\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Kaṇikārapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kaṇikārapupphiya Thera is finished.
