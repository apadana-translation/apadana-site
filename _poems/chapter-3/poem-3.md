\[3. Mahākassapa\]  
When the World-Chief had passed away[^1]  
the people, with exalted minds,  
intoxicated with delight  
did *pūjā* for the Neutral One,  
the Teacher, who was the World’s Best,  
Blessed One, Padumuttara. (1) \[399, 400a-b\]  
When their religious emotion[^2]  
was born, great joy[^3] arose in me.  
Gathering my family and friends  
I spoke these words \[to all of them\]:  
“the Great Hero has passed away;[^4]  
surely we should do a *pūjā*!” (2) \[400c-d, 401\]  
They agreed saying, “Excellent!”  
which made me smile even more.  
“We’ll make a meritorious pyre  
over the Buddha, the World-Chief.”[^5] (3) \[402\]  
We made a well-made festoon work  
which was one hundred hands in height,  
and we raised up into the sky  
a mansion fifty hands higher.[^6] (4) \[403\]  
Having made that festoon work there,  
decorated with rows of stripes,  
bringing pleasure to \[my\] own mind  
I worshipped that excellent shrine. (5) \[404\]  
Like a blazing column of fire,  
like a regal *sal* tree in bloom,  
like Indra’s post up in the sky  
it shined in the four directions. (6) \[405\]  
After making \[my\] mind pleased there[^7]  
and doing much that was wholesome,  
recalling karma from the past  
I was born with the thirty \[gods\].[^8] (7) \[406\]  
I possessed a divine chariot  
yoked with one thousand \[fine\] horses.  
That tall residence of mine \[there\]  
was seven stories \[tall\] in height. (8) \[407\]  
It had one thousand gabled cells;  
all \[of them were\] made out of gold.  
It blazed by means of its own power  
lighting up every direction. (9) \[408\]  
There were also other doorways  
\[all\] made of rubies \[at that time\].  
With their light they too illumined  
the four directions entirely. (10) \[409\]  
Those well-constructed gabled cells  
produced by \[my past\] good karma[^9]  
and \[all\] the gemstone \[doors\] then shined  
in ten directions on all sides. (11) \[410\]  
When they were thus \[all\] shining forth  
there was a massive effulgence.  
I surpassed all the \[other\] gods;  
that is the fruit of good karma. (12) \[411\]  
Sixty thousand aeons ago  
I was the king[^10] named Ubbiddha.  
Victorious on \[all\] four sides  
I took the earth as residence. (13) \[412\]  
In that most auspicious aeon  
for fully thirty times I was  
a wheel-turning king with great strength  
deriving from my own karma. (14) \[413\]  
Possessor of the seven jewels  
I‘m lord of the four continents.  
And in that place my residence  
was as tall as the tree of Indra.[^11] (15) \[413-414\]  
It was twenty-four \[leagues\][^12] in length,  
\[and\] in width \[it measured\] twelve \[leagues\].  
\[My\] city was named Rammaka;  
it had strong ramparts and gateways. (16) \[414-415\]  
It was five hundred \[leagues\] in length,  
in width two hundred fifty \[leagues\].[^13]  
It was crowded with groups of men  
just like the thirty-three gods’ city. (17) \[415\]  
Like needles in a needle-case[^14]  
there were twenty \[different\] bazaars[^15]  
\[where\] they gather, one another;  
\[the city\] was \[very\] crowded. (18) \[416\]  
Of such a sort was my city,  
with elephants, horses, chariots  
and \[very\] crowded with people:  
Rammaka, excellent city. (19) \[417\]  
Having lived there and having left  
I returned to the world of gods.  
In this, my final existence,  
I’m born in an accomplished clan.[^16] (20) \[418\]  
Born into a brahmin family  
I had a massive heap of gems.  
Eight hundred million[^17] \[worth of\] gold[^18]  
abandoned, I went forth renouncing. (21) \[419\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. \[420\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[421\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (22) \[422\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Mahākassapa Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Mahākassapa Thera is finished.
