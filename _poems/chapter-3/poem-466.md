*\[463. {466.}*[^1] *Avaṇṭaphaliya*[^2]*\]*  
The Blessed One, Hundred-Rayed One,[^3]  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
Seclusion-Lover,[^4] Sambuddha,  
went forth in order to seek food. (1) \[4889\]  
\[Holding\] fruit in \[my\] hand I saw  
the Bull of Men who had approached.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I gave \[him\] fruit with stems removed. (2) \[4890\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that fruit \[at that time\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[4891\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[4892\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4893\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4894\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Avaṇṭaphaliya[^5] Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Avaṇṭaphaliya[^6] Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: this is the BJTS spelling; PTS reads *Avaṭaphaliya.* This same
    *apadāna* (with the slight difference that the third and fourth
    verses are inverted there) appears above, titled
    *Avaṇṭaphaladāyaka*-*apadāna*, as \#378 \[381\], and also below,
    \#501 {504}, titled *Avaṭaphaliya-apadāna*. With the name
    *Tālaphaliyaº,* and only a slight change, it also appears as \#506
    {509} The meaning is “Stemless Fruit-er”  
[^3]: *sataraŋsi,* i.e., “the Sun”  
[^4]: *viveka-kāma*  
[^5]: this is the BJTS spelling; PTS reads *Avaṭaphaliya.* Cone (s.v.)
    accepts the spelling *avaṭa* but indicates the possibility that it
    might be a mistake for *avaṇṭa.* Though she recognizes the literal
    meaning of the latter (“stemless”), she treats these *Apadāna*
    passages as references to a type of fruit by that name.  
[^6]: this is the BJTS spelling; PTS reads *Avaṭaphaliya.*
