### \[360. {363.}[^1] Bhisamuḷāladāyaka[^2]\]

The Sambuddha was named[^3] Phussa,  
the \[Great\] Master of Everything.[^4]  
The Seclusion-Lover,[^5] Wise One,[^6]  
came into my presence \[back then\]. (1) \[3187\]

Bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart in  
him, the Victor, Great Compassion,  
taking lotus roots and stems, I  
gave \[them\] to the Best of Buddhas. (2) \[3188\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I gave that lotus-root back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of lotus-root gifts. (3) \[3189\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3190\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bhisamuḷāladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bhisamuḷāladāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Lotus Root and Stem Donor.” *Bhisa* refers to the lotus “potato” (Sinh. *ala*) found under the mud; *muḷāla* refers to the lotus “stem” (Sinh. *daṇḍu*, dictionary gives *däli*). The former is starchy and crunchy; the latter is like a green vegetable. Both are delicious staples of village diets to this day. Cf. \#65.

[^3]: reading *nāmāsi* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *nāmā ti*

[^4]: lit., “master of all things (*dhamma*)” (or “Master of All Teachings”)

[^5]: *viveka-kāma*

[^6]: *suppañña*
