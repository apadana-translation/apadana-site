*Bodhivandaka Chapter, the Thirty-Eighth*

*\[368. {371.}*[^1] *Bodhivandaka*[^2]*\]*

I saw a green *pāṭali*[^3] tree,

foot-drinker growing in the earth.[^4]

Resolutely[^5] pressing my hands,

I worshipped \[that\] *pāṭali* \[tree\]. (1) \[3220\]

Having pressed hands together,

filling[^6] \[my\] mind \[with\] reverence,

purified \[both\] inside \[and\] out,[^7]

I worshipped \[that\] *pāṭali* \[tree\]

as though before[^8] the Sambuddha,

Well-Liberated, Undefiled,[^9]

Vipassi, Honored by the World,

Sea of Compassion and Knowledge. (2-3) \[3221-3222\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I worshipped that Bodhi \[tree then\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of worshipping. (4) \[3223\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[3224\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bodhivandaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bodhivandaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Bodhi \[Tree\] Worshipper.”

[^3]: Sinh. *paḷol,* Bignonia suaveolens, sterospermum suaveolens
    (*Bignon.*), trumpet-flower tree, the Bodhi Tree of Vipassi Buddha.
    Cf. \#71, \#78, \#96, \#248, \#255, \#369{372}.

[^4]: The foot consists of two different words for” tree”:
    *dharaṇī-rūha* (“growing in the earth”) and *pādapa* (“drinking from
    the feet \[or roots\]”). Though awkward in English, I translate
    literally here rather than give the non-descriptive “tree, which was
    a tree”.

[^5]: *ekaŋsam,* with certainty, definitively, absolutely.

[^6]: lit., “making”

[^7]: *antosuddhaŋ bahiŋ suddhaŋ* (reading *bahisuddhaŋ* with BJTS and
    PTS alt.), lit., “purified inside, purified outside.” I follow BJTS
    Sinhala gloss in taking this as referring to the donor (or perhaps,
    in an adverbial sense, to his worship) rather than -- as is also
    grammatically possible -- as a Buddha-epithet, i.e., He Who is
    Purified \[Both\] Inside \[and\] Out”

[^8]: *sammukhā viya,* lit., “as though face to face with”

[^9]: *anāsava*
