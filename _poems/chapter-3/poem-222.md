*\[222. Ajinadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
Thirty-one aeons in the past,[^2]  
I \[made\] mats for the multitude.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
Sacrificial Recipient. (1) \[2378\]

I gave a leather garment to  
Sikhi, the Kinsman of the World.  
Through that karma, O Biped Lord,  
O World’s Best, O Bull of Men,  
experiencing happiness,  
I destroyed \[my\] defilements.  
I \[now\] possess my last body  
in the Buddha’s[^3] dispensation. (2-3) \[2379-2380\]  
In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave that deer\[-leather to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of deer\[-leather\]. (4) \[2381\]

In the fifth aeon after that  
there was a king, Sudāyaka,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king of great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[2382\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2383\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ajinadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ajinadāyaka Thera is finished.
