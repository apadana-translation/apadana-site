### \[470. {473.}[^1] Ukkāsatika[^2]\]

The Blessed One named Kosika,  
Meditator, Trance-Loving One,  
Buddha, Seclusion-Lover, Sage,  
lived on Cittakūṭa[^3] back then. (1) \[4965\]

Plunged[^4] into the Himalayas,  
attended by troops of women,  
I saw \[him\], Kosika Buddha,  
like the moon on the fifteenth day.[^5] (2) \[4966\]

With[^6] a hundred flaming\[-torches,\][^7]  
I waited on \[him\] at that time.  
Remaining seven nights and days,  
on the eighth \[day\] I departed.[^8] (3) \[4967\]

With a pleased heart, having worshipped  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
Kosika Buddha, \[when\] he rose,  
I \[also\] gave one meal \[to him\]. (4) \[4968\]

Through that karma for the World’s Best,  
the Biped-Lord, the Bull of Men,  
I was reborn in Tusitā:[^9]  
that is the fruit of \[that\] one meal. (5) \[4969\]

During the day and also at  
night, there is always light for me;  
on all sides for a hundred leagues,  
I am permeated by light. (6) \[4970\]

In the fifty-fifth aeon hence  
I was a king who turns the wheel,  
lord of the grove of rose-apples,[^10]  
victorious on \[all\] four sides.[^11] (7) \[4971\]

My city at that time was rich,  
prosperous and well-constructed.  
\[It measured\] thirty leagues in length,  
and \[it was\] twenty leagues in width. (8) \[4972\]

\[My\] city was named Sobhana;[^12]  
\[it\] was built by Vissakamma.  
\[It\] did not lack for the ten sounds,[^13]  
well-accompanied by cymbals.[^14] (9) \[4973\]

No\[thing\] in that city was \[made  
of\][^15] sticks \[or of\] vines \[or of\] clay.  
Everything was made out of gold,  
\[and\] it was shining all the time. (10) \[4974\]

Four rampart walls surrounded \[it\];  
they were constructed out of gems.  
In the middle, a palmyra  
pond[^16] was made by Vissakamma. (11) \[4975\]

\[There were\] ten thousand ponds \[as well\],  
covered with pink and blue lotus,  
covered with white lotuses \[too\],  
\[all\] exuding varied perfumes. (12) \[4976\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I carried those torches[^17] \[for him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of carrying torches. (13) \[4977\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (14) \[4978\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (15) \[4979\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (16) \[4980\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ukkāsatika Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ukkāsatika Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Hundred-Flame-er”

[^3]: = Citrakūṭa, a mountain in the Himalayas, one of five said to surround Lake Anottata (Anavatapta), composed of all precious metals and famed for golden swans living in a golden cave. DPPN I:869: “It is generally identified with Kāmptanāthgiri in Bundelkhand, an isolated hill on the Paisunī or Mandākinī River”

[^4]: lit., “plunging”

[^5]: i.e., when it is full, *puṇṇamāse va candimā*

[^6]: *gahetvā*, lit., “taking”

[^7]: following BJTS in understanding these “flames” as “torches with flames”

[^8]: *agamas’*, lit., “I left” “I went \[away\]”

[^9]: *tusite kāye*, lit., “in a Tusitā body” or “in the Tusitā group”

[^10]: *jambusaṇḍa* = *jambudīpa* = India, the South Asian continent

[^11]: *caturanto vijitāvi*, “possessed of conquest of the four quarters,” a supreme imperial overlord

[^12]: “beautiful”

[^13]: reading *dasasadda* + *a* + *vivittantaṃ* with BJTS for PTS *dasasaddâvivittan taŋ*.

[^14]: reading *sammatāḷaº* (BJTS) for *samatāḷaº* (PTS).

[^15]: I follow BJTS Sinhala gloss in interpolating “thing” as the subject of the half-verse, which otherwise would mean that sticks, vines and clay were themselves absent from (*n’atthi*, “do not exist”) in that city.

[^16]: *tālapattī*, BJTS gloss *tālapaṅkhatīhu*

[^17]: lit., “that,” but given that the torches numbered one hundred, I translate it as the plural pronoun
