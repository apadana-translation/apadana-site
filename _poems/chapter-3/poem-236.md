### \[236. Vaṇṇakāraka[^1]\]

In Aruṇavatī city  
I was a dyer at that time.  
With various colors I dyed  
the cloth items on the stupa.[^2] (1) \[2446\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I dyed with colors at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that’s the fruit of giving colors. (2) \[2447\]

In the twenty-third aeon hence  
\[I was one\] named <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andupama,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2448\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2449\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vaṇṇakāraka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Vaṇṇakāraka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Dyer” (*vaṇṇa* = color, hence lit., “color-er;” cf. *vaṇṇaka*, dye, perfume)

[^2]: *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>etiye*. These would presumably consist of banners, flags, and/or girdles attached to the stupa. *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>etiya* can also mean any shrine, so it is also possible that we should think of the cloths as curtains, robes on statues, and/or table cloths in an image house, or flags and so forth attached to a Bodhi tree.

[^3]: “Moon-like” or “Similar to the Moon”
