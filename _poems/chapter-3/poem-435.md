*\[432. {435.}*[^1] *Ucchukaṇḍika*[^2]*\]*  
In the city, Bandhumatī,  
I was a gate-keeper \[back then\].  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
\[who was\] Master of Everything. (1) \[4673\]  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
bringing a stalk of sugarcane,[^3]  
I gave it to \[him,\] the Best Buddha,  
the Great Sage \[known as\] Vipassi. (2) \[4674\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[the Buddha\] sugar-cane,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of a sugar-cane stalk. (3) \[4675\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[4676\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4677\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4678\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Ucchukaṇḍika[^4] Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ucchukaṇḍika[^5] Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Stalk of Sugarcane-er” BJTS reads *Ucchukhaṇḍika* (“Broken
    Bit/Stick of Sugarcane”)  
[^3]: *ucchu + kaṇḍika*, fr. *kaṇḍa,* a reed or stalk or arrow shaft (or
    the entire arrow). BJTS reads *ucchu + khaṇḍaka*, with much the same
    meaning. Sugar-cane grows like bamboo, shooting up discrete stalks
    or canes (hence the name) which are then chewed raw, or boiled and
    processed into granulated sugar.
