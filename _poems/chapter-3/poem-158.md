### \[158. Nāgapupphiya[^1]\]

There was a man named Suvaccha[^2]  
a brahmin master of mantras,  
placed in front by his own students,  
residing upon a mountain. (1) \[2031\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
with a wish for my upliftment  
did come into my presence \[then\]. (2) \[2032\]

He walked back and forth in the sky,  
like he was smoking and burning,[^3]  
\[and\] after he had made me smile,[^4]  
he departed facing the east. (3) \[2033\]

And having seen that miracle,  
marvel making hair stand on end,  
taking an ironwood flower,  
I scattered \[it\] in his pathway.[^5] (4) \[2034\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I scattered that flower \[then\],  
due to the pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth. (5) \[2035\]

In the thirty-first aeon \[hence\]  
I was the king, Mahāratha,[^6]  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (6) \[2036\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[2037\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nāgapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Nāgapupphiya Thera is finished.
