### \[454. {457.}[^1] Ekachattiya[^2]\]

The world had turned to \[burning\] coal,  
the earth was mixed with hot embers.[^3]  
Padumuttara, Blessed One,  
walked back and forth in open air. (1) \[4833\]

Carrying a white umbrella,  
I proceeded along a road.  
Having seen the Sambuddha there,  
I experienced happiness. (2) \[4834\]

“The ground is full of \[the sun’s\] rays;  
this earth is like \[burning\] charcoal.  
The gusty winds[^4] that are blowing  
deplete the breath of the body.[^5] (3) \[4835\]

Please accept this, \[my\] umbrella,  
which blocks the \[sun’s\] heat \[and\] the winds,  
killing[^6] \[both\] the heat and the cold;  
\[through it\] I will touch nirvana.” (4) \[4836\]

Merciful, Compassionate One,  
Padumuttara, Greatly Famed,  
discerning what I was thinking,  
the Victor then accepted \[it\]. (5) \[4837\]

Lord of gods for thirty aeons,  
I exercised divine rule \[then,\]  
and five hundred \[different\] times,  
I was a king who turns the wheel. (6) \[4838\]

\[There was also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting.  
I’m enjoying my own karma,  
formerly well-done by myself. (7) \[4839\]

This is the final time for me;  
\[my\] last rebirth is proceeding.[^7]  
Even now[^8] a white umbrella  
is carried for me all the time. (8) \[4840\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave that umbrella then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of giving umbrellas. (9) \[4841\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (10) \[4842\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[4843\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[4844\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekachattiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekachattiya Thera is finished.
