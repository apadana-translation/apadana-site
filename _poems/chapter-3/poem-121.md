## Sereyyaka Chapter, the Thirteenth

### \[121. Sereyyaka[^1]\]

I was a learned mantra-knower  
who had mastered the three Vedas.  
While standing in the open air  
I saw the Leader of the World, (1) \[1767\]

wandering the woods like a lion,  
untrembling like a tiger-king,  
the Great Sage, like an elephant,  
a *mātaṅga*[^2] in three-fold rut.[^3] (2) \[1768\]

Picking up \[some\] jasmine[^4] flower\[s,\]  
I tossed \[them\] up into the air.  
By the power of the Buddha,  
they fully surrounded \[him there\]. (3) \[1769\]

The Great Hero stood unmoving,  
the World-Leader, Omniscient One.  
On all sides they scattered flowers,  
\[thus\] covering the Bull of Men.[^5] (4) \[1770\]

There a canopy of flowers  
with stems inside and blossoms out  
having covered \[him\] for a week  
\[afterward\] then disappeared. (5) \[1771\]

And having seen that miracle,  
marvel making hair stand on end,  
I pleased \[my\] heart in the Buddha,  
the Well-Gone-One, the World-Leader. (6) \[1772\]

Due to that pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
incited by \[my\] wholesome roots,  
for one hundred thousand aeons,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth. (7) \[1773\]

In the fifteen-thousandth aeon  
there were five more than twenty men,  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
\[all\] known as Cīnamāla[^6] \[then\]. (8) \[1774\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1775\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sereyyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sereyyaka Thera is finished.
