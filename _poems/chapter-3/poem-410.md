### \[407. {410.}[^1] Udena[^2]\]

In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named Paduma.[^3]  
My well-built hermitage \[is there,\]  
with well-fashioned halls made of leaves. (1) \[4219\]

The rivers that are flowing there  
have good banks and are beautiful,  
with clear water, water that’s cool;  
\[those\] rivers are always lovely. (2) \[4220\]

There are sheatfish,[^4] *pāvusa*[^5] fish,  
*valaja*,[^6] reed-fish[^7] \[and\] red-fish.[^8]  
They are shining[^9] in the river;  
the rivers always transport \[them\].[^10](3) \[4221\]

They’re veiled[^11] in mango,[^12] rose-apple,[^13]  
*kareri*[^14] \[and\] coral-bean tree,[^15]  
golden shower,[^16] trumpet-flower,[^17]  
beautifying my hermitage. (4) \[4222\]

Alangium,[^18] red *bimbijāl*,[^19]  
and *māyākārī*[^20] \[trees\] in bloom  
are diffusing perfumes \[there\],  
beautifying my hermitage. (5) \[4223\]

Hiptage vines[^21] and *sattalika*,[^22]  
ironwood[^23] \[and\] *sal*[^24] in flower  
are wafting divine fragrances,  
beautifying my hermitage. (6) \[4224\]

Neem,[^25] *salalā*,[^26] yellow cheesewood[^27]  
and *aṭṭhaṅga*[^28] \[trees\] in full bloom,  
are wafting divine fragrances,  
beautifying my hermitage. (7) \[4225\]

My hermitage has lots of fruit:  
myrobalan[^29] \[and\] gooseberry,[^30]  
mango,[^31] rose-apple,[^32] bahera,[^33]  
jujube,[^34] markingnut,[^35] bel.[^36] (8) \[4226\]

There kadam[^37] and banana \[trees\]  
are flowering in my hermitage.  
Wafting divine fragrances, they’re  
beautifying my hermitage. (9) \[4227\]

*Asokapiṇḍī*,[^38] *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>avarī*,[^39]  
and yellow cheesewood[^40] \[trees\] in bloom,  
are wafting divine fragrances,  
beautifying my hermitage. (10) \[4228\]

Laurel[^41] \[and\] mountain laurel[^42] \[trees\]  
\[and\] *timira* \[trees\] in bloom there,  
are wafting divine fragrances,  
beautifying my hermitage. (11) \[4229\]

*Nigguṇḍi*,[^43] *sirinigguṇḍi*[^44]  
and champak trees[^45] which are in bloom,  
are wafting divine fragrances,  
beautifying my hermitage. (12) \[4230\]

Near \[the hermitage\] there’s a pond,  
\[full of\] the songs of ruddy geese,[^46]  
covered with *mandālaka* blooms[^47]  
and with pink and blue lotuses.[^48] (13) \[4231\]

It has clear water, cool water,  
good bathing-fords[^49] which are lovely.  
It is clear, the same as crystal,  
beautifying my hermitage. (14) \[4232\]

Pink lotuses are blooming there,  
and white and blue lotuses \[too\].  
It’s covered in *mandālaka*,[^50]  
beautifying my hermitage. (15) \[4233\]

Sheatfish[^51] \[also\] *pāvusa*[^52] fish,  
*valaja*,[^53] reed-fish[^54] \[and\] red-fish[^55]  
are swimming around[^56] in that \[pond\],[^57]  
beautifying my hermitage. (16) \[4234\]

Crocodiles[^58] and alligators,[^59]  
tortoises and \[other\] fierce beasts,[^60]  
*ogāhas*,[^61] \[and\] pythons[^62] \[too are\]  
beautifying my hermitage. (17) \[4235\]

Pigeons[^63] and *ravi*-swans[^64] as well,  
ruddy geese[^65] and *nadī<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ara*\s,  
lapwings,[^66] \[also\] mynah birds[^67] are  
beautifying my hermitage. (18) \[4236\]

Shrubs like *nayita*, *ambagandhi*,  
and screw-pine[^68] are blossoming there,  
wafting \[their\] divine fragrances,  
beautifying my hermitage. (19) \[4237\]

Lions and tigers and leopards,  
bears[^69] \[and\] wolves,[^70] *kara bānā* bears[^71]  
are roaming about in the woods,  
beautifying my hermitage. (20) \[4238\]

Those bearing weights of matted hair,[^72]  
who wear deer-leather outer robes,  
are roaming about in the woods,  
beautifying my hermitage. (21) \[4239\]

Those \[hermits\] wearing deer-leather  
are clever, living peacefully,  
and they’re all eating little food,  
beautifying my hermitage. (22) \[4240\]

Carrying their[^73] shoulder yokes,[^74]  
plunging into the forest then,  
eating \[only\] roots and \[wild\] fruits,  
\[they\] live in the hermitage then.[^75] (23) \[4241\]

They do not carry wood for fires  
nor water for washing \[their\] feet;  
through their collective majesty,[^76]  
\[that all\] gets carried by itself. (24) \[4242\]

Those eighty-four thousand sages  
gathered together in that place;  
all practice meditation[^77] and  
are seeking ultimate meaning. (25) \[4243\]

All are ascetics, celibates,  
reproving,[^78] with vows for fixed minds[^79]  
and able to fly through the sky;[^80]  
\[they\] live in the hermitage then. (26) \[4244\]

For five days they would congregate,  
tranquil \[and\] living peacefully,  
\[then\] worshipping one another,  
they’re departing the way they face.[^81] (27) \[4245\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
was the Master of Everything.[^82]  
Doing away with the darkness,  
the Victor arose at that time. (28) \[4246\]

There was a powerful spirit[^83]  
\[then,\] living near my hermitage.  
He praised[^84] the Sambuddha to me,  
the one named “Ultimate Lotus.”[^85] (29) \[4247\]

“It is a Buddha who arose,  
the Great Sage, Padumuttara;  
having gone quickly, Sir,[^86] you now  
should visit \[him\], the Sambuddha.”[^87] (30) \[4248\]

After hearing the spirit’s words,  
with a mind that was very clear,  
having shored up[^88] the hermitage;  
I then set out from the forest. (31) \[4249\]

As though \[my\] clothes were now in flames,[^89]  
quickly leaving the hermitage,  
staying over a single night,[^90]  
I came up to \[Buddha\], the Guide. (32) \[4250\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
explaining the Four Noble Truths,  
was declaring the deathless path. (33) \[4251\]

Taking a pink lotus in bloom,[^91]  
I went up to the Sage So Great.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I offered it to the Buddha. (34) \[4252\]

Having worshipped[^92] the Sambuddha  
whose name was “Ultimate Lotus,”  
placing deer-hide on one shoulder,  
I praised the Leader of the World: (35) \[2453\]

“That knowledge by which the Buddha  
\[now\] dwells here without defilements,  
I shall eulogize that knowledge;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words. (36) \[2454\]

Blocking the stream of existence,[^93]  
you ferry all creatures across.  
Having listened to your Teaching,  
they’re crossing the stream of craving.[^94] (37) \[2455\]

You’re the Teacher for those who breathe,  
the Banner, the Flag and the Pole;  
you are the Goal, the Solid Ground,  
the Island,[^95] the Best of Bipeds. (38) \[2456\]

The heads of groups[^96] throughout the world  
are said to be leading teachers.[^97]  
You are the Chief, Omniscient One;  
they \[have all\] come into your fold.[^98] (39) \[4257\]

Through your knowledge, Omniscient One,[^99]  
you ferry many folks across.  
Coming to take a look at you,  
they make an end to suffering. (40) \[4258\]

Whatever perfumes are produced,  
waft through this world, O Eyeful One.  
None is equal to your \[sweet\] scent,  
O Field of Merit, O Great Sage. (41) \[4259\]

O Eyeful One, you liberate  
from woeful states,[^100] \[and\] wombs of beasts.[^101]  
O Great Sage, you are explaining  
the unconditioned path of peace.” (42) \[4260\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly,  
spoke these verses \[about me then\]: (43) \[4261\]

“He who \[thus\] worshipped[^102] my knowledge,  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[his\] own hands,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (44) \[4262\]

For thirty thousand aeons he  
will delight in the world of gods.  
A thousand time’s he’ll be a king,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\].” (45) \[4263\]

The gain for me was well-received,  
having pleased \[him\], the Sambuddha.  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled. (46) \[4264\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (47) \[4265\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (48) \[4266\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (49) \[4267\]

Thus indeed Venerable Udena Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Udena Thera is finished.

[^74]: *khāribhāriŋ* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *khāribhāraṃ*) *gahetvāna*. These are specified as ascetics who carry all their requisites, which are few, on their persons.

[^75]: in this verse <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *sadā* (“always” “all the time”) for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *tadā*, “then,” but agrees with the latter in subsequent repetitions of this foot.

[^76]: *sabbesam anubhāvena*, lit., “through the majestic (or even magical) powers of all of them.” The point here is that their power is so great that they do not need to perform mundane chores; those chores perform themselves, as it were.

[^79]: *appanā* \[<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *appaṇā*\] *vate*, Sinh. gloss *arpaṇāvratayehi yodunā vu*. *Appanā* is fixing the mind on its object (the *samādhis* or the Path), that conception itself, ecstasy. In Sinhala this implies “giving up,” “renunciation,” of other objects of thought

[^87]: though the meaning of both is about the same, there is considerable variation between the readings of the final foot in <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> (*payirupāsaya mārisa*), which I follow, and <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> (*payirupāsassu tam muni*), which I find garbled.

[^98]: *tava antogadhā va te*, or perhaps “they are all now under you” or “they’re all encompassed by you”

[^99]: reading *sabbaññū* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *sapañño* (“the one who has wisdom”)
