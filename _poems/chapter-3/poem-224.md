### \[224. Ārakkhadāyaka[^1]\]

I caused an altar[^2] to be made  
for Siddhattha, the Blessed One,  
and I \[also\] gave protection  
to the Well-Gone One, the Great Sage. (1) \[2391\]

As the remainder of that deed,  
fear and terror I do not see.  
Wherever I have been reborn,  
no fright is \[ever\] known by me. (2) \[2392\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I caused that altar to be made,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of an altar\[-gift\]. (3) \[2393\]

\[And\] in the sixth aeon ago  
\[lived\] one known as Apassena,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2394\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2395\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ārakkhadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ārakkhadāyaka Thera is finished.
