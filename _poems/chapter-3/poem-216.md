*\[216. Saṇṭhita*[^1]*\]*

I obtained perception of the

Mindful One, \[seeing\] a Buddha

gone beneath an Aśvattha[^2] tree,

full-grown and brightly shining green. (1) \[2345\]

In the thirty-one aeons since

I obtained that perception then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

the fruit of perceiving Buddha. (2) \[2346\]

In the thirtieth aeon hence

lived the monarch[^3] named Dhanittha,[^4]

a wheel-turning king with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2347\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2348\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saṇṭhita Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Saṇṭhita Thera is finished.
