*Avaṇṭaphala Chapter, the Thirty-Ninth*

*\[378. {381.}*[^1] *Avaṇṭaphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*

The Blessed One, Hundred-Rayed One,[^3]

the Self-Become, Unconquered One,

Seclusion-Lover,[^4] Sambuddha,

went forth in order to seek food. (1) \[3278\]

\[Holding\] fruit in \[my\] hand, I saw

the Bull of Men who had approached.

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,

I gave \[him\] fruit with stems removed. (2) \[3279\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I gave \[him\] that fruit \[at that time\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[3280\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3281\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (5) \[3282\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[3283\]

Thus indeed Venerable Avaṇṭaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Avaṇṭaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.
