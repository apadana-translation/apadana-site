### \[374. {377.}[^1] Citapūjaka[^2]\]

When the Blessed One passed away[^3] —  
\[the one\] named “Ultimate Lotus”[^4] —  
when the stupa had been raised up,  
I offered[^5] \[it\] a *sal* flower. (1) \[3257\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I did that flower-*pūjā*,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of stupa-*pūjā*. (2) \[3258\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3259\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[3260\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[3261\]

Thus indeed Venerable Citapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Citapūjaka Thera is finished.
