### \[4. Anuruddha\]

I caught a glimpse of the World-Chief,  
the Blessed One \[named\] Sumedha,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
while he was dwelling in solitude.[^1] (1) \[423\]

So I approached that Sambuddha,  
Sumedha, the Chief of the World,  
and holding up hands pressed together  
I said to \[him\], the Best Buddha: (2) \[424\]

“With your permission,[^2] Great Hero  
o World’s Best One, O Bull of Men,  
I shall light a lamp for you while  
you meditate beneath that tree.” (3) \[425\]

That Wise One signaled his assent[^3]  
the Self-Existent, Best Debater.[^4]  
I then contrived a mechanism  
by piercing through some tree \[trunks there\]. (4) \[426\]

I set afire a thousand wicks  
for the Buddha, the World’s Kinsman.  
For a week I kept them \[all\] lit  
\[and then\] those lamps were extinguished. (5) \[427\]

Due to the pleasure in \[my\] heart  
and that intention and resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body  
I’m born in a \[divine\] mansion. (6) \[428\]

There was a pillar, well-proportioned  
for me born in that divine state.  
It blazed forth on every side \[then\]:  
that is the fruit of giving lamps. (7) \[429\]

On every side for a whole league  
I \[myself\] shined forth at that time.  
I surpassed all the \[other\] gods:  
that is the fruit of giving lamps. (8) \[430\]

For thirty aeons, king of gods  
I exercised divine rule \[then\].  
No one at all neglected me:  
that is the fruit of giving lamps. (9) \[431\]

And also eight and twenty times  
I was a wheel-turning monarch.  
Both day and night I could \[then\] see  
an entire league surrounding \[me\]. (10) \[432\]

With knowledge of one thousand worlds,  
I see in the dispensation.[^5]  
The “divine eye” is \[now\] attained:  
that is the fruit of giving lamps. (11) \[433\]

That Sambuddha named Sumedha  
lived thirty thousand aeons hence.  
To him a lamp was given by me  
with a mind that was very clear. (12) \[434\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. \[435\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[436\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (13) \[437\]

Thus indeed Venerable Anuruddha Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Anuruddha Thera is finished.
