### \[252. Ekāsanadāyaka[^1]\]

Sloughing off[^2] my godly color,[^3]  
I came to this place with my wife,  
desiring to do service to  
the Best Buddha’s dispensation.[^4] (1) \[2503\]

Padumuttara’s follower  
was known by the name Devala.[^5]  
With a mind that was very clear,  
I provided alms-food to him. (2) \[2504\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I did that \[good\] karma then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving begged alms.[^6] (3) \[2505\]

The four analytical modes  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered:  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2506\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekāsanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekāsanadāyaka Thera is finished.
