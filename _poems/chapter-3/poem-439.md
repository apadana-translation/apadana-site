*\[436. {439.}*[^1] *Ambapiṇḍiya*[^2]*\]*  
I was then an elephant-king,  
with tusks like plough-poles, fully grown.  
Wandering in a large forest,[^3]  
I saw the Leader of the World. (1) \[4701\]

Taking a cluster of mangoes,[^4]  
I gave \[them\] to \[him,\] the Teacher.  
The Great Hero accepted them,  
Siddhattha, Leader of the World. (2) \[4702\]

While I[^5] meditated \[on him\],  
the Victor then consumed \[that fruit\].  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart there,  
I was reborn in Tusitā.[^6] (3) \[4703\]

After falling down from there, I  
was a monarch who turns the wheel.  
\[Then\] through that very method, I,  
having enjoyed \[great\] good fortune,[^7]  
being one bent on exertion,  
calmed,[^8] devoid of grounds for rebirth,[^9]  
knowing well all the defilements,  
am living \[here now,\] undefiled. (4-5) \[4704-4705\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave that fruit \[to him\] back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (6) \[4706\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (7) \[4707\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[4708\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[4709\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ambapiṇḍiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ambapiṇḍiya Thera is finished.

[^4]: *ambapiṇḍi.* The term can mean “lump”or “round mass” too, but it’s
    not clear how an elephant would get or make a lump or ball of mango
    to present a Buddha; “mango-cud” seems unlikely. Wild elephants eat
    by breaking branches, fronds or stems off trees and shrubs with
    their trunks, and the image here seems to be along those lines:
    mangoes fruit in clusters along branches, and the protagonist has
    apparently broken off such a branch, clustered with mangoes, to give
    the Buddha.
