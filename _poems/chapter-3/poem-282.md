*\[282. Phaladāyaka*[^1]*\]*

Rising up from meditation,[^2]

\[the Buddha\][^3] approached me for alms.

Same as the cosmic mountain,[^4] he

was like the bearer of the earth.[^5] (1) \[2627\]

Myrobalan[^6] \[and\] gooseberry,[^7]

mango,[^8] rose-apple,[^9] bahera,[^10]

jujube,[^11] markingnut,[^12] bel,[^13]

and the fruits of *phārusaka*[^14] *--*

all of that was given by me,

with a mind that was very clear,

to Siddhattha \[Buddha\], Great Sage,

the Pitier of Every World.[^15] (2-3) \[2628-2629\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I gave that fruit \[to him\] back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of giving fruit. (4) \[2630\]

In the fifty-seventh aeon

hence \[lived\] a ruler,[^16] Ekajjha,[^17]

a wheel-turning king with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[2631\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2632\]

Thus indeed Venerable Phaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Phaladāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Fruit-Donor”. cf. \#87, \#127, \#140, \#305 (more? xxx)

[^2]: lit., “from *samādhi*”

[^3]: Suddhattha Buddha, as becomes clear in v. 3, and is confirmed by
    the dating of ninety-four aeons ago in v. 4.

[^4]: Sineru, Mt. Meru

[^5]: this extends the prior simile: “being the same as Mt. Meru”
    implies that he “upholds the earth,” a quality of the cosmic
    mountain.

[^6]: Sinh. *araḷu,* myrobalan, black- or chebulic myrobalan; Terminalia
    chebula. The list of fruits in this verse closely parallels that in
    TherAp \#1, v. 33 \[BJTS 168\] above, but there the focus is on
    their flowers, not their fruits.

[^7]: Sinh. *nelli*, emblic myrobalan, Indian gooseberry, a.k.a. Malacca
    tree, or amla; Phyllanthus emblica

[^8]: *amba*, Magnifera indica

[^9]: Sinh. *damba, jambu,* Syzygium samarangense

[^10]: *vibhīṭaka*, Sinh. *buḷu*, Terminalia bellirica (sic bellerica),
    beleric myrobalan or bastard myrobalan. Together with myroblan
    proper (*araḷu*) and Indian gooseberry *(nelli*), bahera is one of
    the three myroblans upon which many Ayurvedic and Sinhala medicines
    are based; the dried nuts are typically pounded into powder which is
    then used in oils and other decoctions. Here, on the contrary, the
    reference is likely to the fresh fruit of these trees, which is also
    used in medicines and eaten (especially gooseberrry).

[^11]: *kola*, Sinh. *debara phala,* Ziziphus Mauritania, Zyzyphus
    Jujuba, Indian jujube or Chinese apple.

[^12]: *bhallī, badulla* = semecarpus anacardium, Sinh. *badulu*

[^13]: *billaŋ* = Aegle marmelos, Sinh. *beli geḍiya,* bael, bel, Bengal
    quince; bilva or vilva tree; also *billā, beluvā*

[^14]: Sinh. *boraḷu damanu,* a species of Eugenia.

[^15]: *sabbalokānukampito*

[^16]: kṣatriyan

[^17]: “Together” (taking it fr. *ekajjhaṃ*)
