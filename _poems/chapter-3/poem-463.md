### \[460. {463.}[^1] <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itakanibbāpaka[^2]\]

When the corpse was being burnt of  
Vessabhu \[Buddha\], the Great Sage,  
taking \[sweetly-\]scented water,  
I put out the funeral pyre. (1) \[4874\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I put out that funeral pyre,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of scented water. (2) \[4875\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4876\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4877\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4878\]

Thus indeed Venerable <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itakanibbāpaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itakanibbāpaka Thera is finished.
