## Ekapadumiya Chapter, the Thirty-Fifth

### \[338. {341.}[^1] Ekapadumiya[^2]\]

The Victor Padumuttara  
was the Master of Everything.[^3]  
Explaining[^4] all existences,[^5]  
he ferried many folks across. (1) \[3074\]

At that time I was a swan-king;  
I was distinguished among birds.  
Plunged into a natural lake,  
I am sporting the sports of swans. (2) \[3075\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the Victor would fly,[^6] all the time,  
over that natural lake \[there\]. (3) \[3076\]

I having seen the God of Gods,  
the Self-Become One, World-Leader,  
gathered lotuses with my beak —  
lovely, with a hundred petals —  
\[and\] having broken off the stems,  
tossing them into the sky, I  
did *pūjā* to the Best Buddha,  
pleased by[^7] the Leader of the World. (4-5) \[3077-3078\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the Teacher, standing in the sky,  
gave me this expression of thanks:[^8] (6) \[3079\]

“Due to this single lotus \[gift\],  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
you won’t fall into[^9] suffering.”[^10] (7) \[3080\]

Having said this the Sambuddha  
whose name was Ultimate Lotus,[^11]  
after detailing my karma,  
went according to his wishes. (8) \[3081\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I did that \[good\] karma then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (9) \[3082\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[3083\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekapadumiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekapadumiya Thera is finished.
