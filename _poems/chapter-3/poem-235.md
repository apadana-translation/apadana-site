*\[235. Vediyadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I caused a railing to be made  
at the superb base of Blessed  
Vipassi’s Bodhi Tree. (1) \[2442\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I had that railing constructed,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (2) \[2443\]

In the eleventh aeon hence  
I was \[named\] Sūriyassama,[^2]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2444\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2445\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vediyadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Vediyadāyaka Thera is finished.
