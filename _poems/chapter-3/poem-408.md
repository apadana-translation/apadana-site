### \[405. {408.}[^1] Todeyya[^2]\]

In Ketumati, best city,  
there was a king named Vijaya,[^3]  
a hero, endowed with great strength,[^4]  
inhabiting \[that\] city then. (1) \[4113\]

Because of that king’s indolence,  
wild men of the forest[^5] rose up.  
They were spies,[^6] and men with foul mouths;[^7]  
they laid waste to the country then. (2) \[4114\]

When the borderlands angered \[him\],  
the king[^8] then quickly assembled  
\[his\] dependents[^9] and officers,[^10]  
to restrain[^11] \[all those\] enemies. (3) \[4115\]

Elephant-riders,[^12] sentinels,[^13]  
champions,[^14] shield-bearing soldiers,[^15]  
archers[^16] and mighty noblemen:[^17]  
they all assembled at that time. (4) \[4116\]

The cooks[^18] \[and\] those who dress the hair,[^19]  
the bath boys,[^20] the garland-makers,[^21]  
heroes[^22] \[and\] conquering soldiers:[^23]  
they all assembled at that time. (5) \[4117\]

The swordsmen[^24] as well as the waiters,[^25]  
bowmen and people in armor,  
hunters[^26] and conquering soldiers:[^27]  
they all assembled at that time. (6) \[4118\]

*Mātaṅga*\s[^28] rutting in three ways[^29]  
\[and\] tuskers sixty years of age,  
adorned with headdresses of gold:  
they all assembled at that time. (7) \[4119\]

The soldiers[^30] who have done the job,[^31]  
enduring[^32] cold \[as well as\] heat,  
also excrement-removal:[^33]  
they all assembled at that time. (8) \[4120\]

The sound of conchs, the sound of drums,  
and thus the sound of trumpets;[^34]  
they being gladded by those \[sounds\]  
did all assemble at that time. (9) \[4121\]

Those who crush and those who injure[^35]  
with tridents[^36] \[and\] knives[^37] \[and\] mantras,[^38]  
suits of armor, also lances:  
they all assembled at that time. (10) \[4122\]

Dressing in a suit of armor[^39]  
that king, victory-less victor,[^40]  
impaled on tridents at that time  
sixty thousand living beings. (11) \[4123\]

The people then let out the cry,[^41]  
“Alas! the king is unrighteous.  
When will there \[ever\] be an end  
for one who is roasting in hell?”[^42] (12) \[4124\]

On the bed I then tossed and turned,[^43]  
\[as though\][^44] I’m lying down[^45] in hell:[^46]  
I do not sleep by day and night;  
they torture me with a trident. (13) \[4125\]

“What good is[^47] \[this\] careless kingship,  
\[these\] vehicles \[or this\] army?  
They aren’t able to support \[me\];  
they terrify me all the time. (14) \[4126\]

What good are \[these\] sons \[and these\] wives,  
\[as well as this\] entire kingship?  
Well then why don’t I \[now\] go forth?  
I will cleanse the road to rebirth. (15) \[4127\]

Disregarding \[all my\] wealth \[and\]  
fighting battles I abandoned  
\[my\] sixty thousand elephants  
decked out in all the ornaments,  
*mātaṅga*\s with gold headdresses,  
clothed in harnessing made of gold,  
mounted by elephant-trainers  
with lances and goads in \[their\] hands.[^48]  
Frightened by \[my\] own \[bad\] karma,  
I went out into homelessness. (16-18a-b) \[4128-4129\][^49]

\[My\] sixty thousand horses \[too\],  
decked out in all the ornaments,  
thoroughbreds of good pedigree,[^50]  
horses from Sindh, fast vehicles,  
mounted by trainers of horses[^51]  
wearing armor with bows in hand —  
having abandoned all of them,  
I went out into homelessness. (18c-d-20a-b) \[4130-4131\]

Sixty thousand chariots \[too\],  
decked out in all the ornaments,  
covered in[^52] the skins of leopards  
and likewise tigers,[^53] flags hoisted —  
having abandoned all of them,  
I went forth into homelessness. (20c-d-21) \[4132\][^54]

Sixty thousand milch-cows \[as well\],  
\[and\] all the metal pails for milk[^55] —  
eliminating even them,  
I went forth into homelessness. (22) \[4133\]

\[My\] sixty thousand women \[too\],  
decked out in all the ornaments,  
with varied clothes and jewelry  
and wearing earrings made of gems,  
with long eyelashes, lovely smiles[^56]  
and slim waists, pleasant to look at[^57] —  
abandoning them as they wept,  
I went forth into homelessness. (23-24) \[4134-4135\]

\[And\] sixty thousand villages,  
completely full in all regards —  
throwing away that \[whole\] kingship,  
I went forth into homelessness. (25) \[4136\]

Having gone out from the city,  
I approached the Himalayas.  
On Bhāgīrathī[^58] River’s banks,  
I constructed a hermitage. (26) \[4137\]

Having built a hall out of leaves  
I made \[myself\] a heated room;[^59]  
bent on exertion,[^60] resolute,[^61]  
I’m living in my hermitage. (27) \[4138\]

Terror does not arise in me;  
I don’t see frights or fearful \[things\]  
when meditating under trees,  
in pavilions[^62] or empty homes. (28) \[4139\]

The Sambuddha named Sumedha,  
Chief, Compassionate One, the Sage,  
blazing with the light of knowledge,  
arose in the world at that time. (29) \[4140\]

There was a powerful spirit[^63]  
living near my hermitage \[then\].  
When the Best Buddha came to be,  
he then announced \[that fact\] to me: (30) \[4141\]

“A Buddha’s risen in the world,  
an Eyeful One named Sumedha;  
he’s \[helping\] all the folk to cross;  
he will ferry you across too.” (31) \[4142\]

After hearing the spirit’s words,  
all the time I was[^64] deeply moved;[^65]  
thinking, “A Buddha! A Buddha!”  
I made my hermitage ready. (32) \[4143\]

After chopping wood for the fire  
and smoothing out \[my\] sleeping mat,  
having worshipped my hermitage,  
I went out from the forest \[then\]. (33) \[4144\]

Taking sandalwood from village  
to village, city to city,  
searching for \[him\], the God of Gods,  
I then came up to \[him\], the Guide. (34) \[4145\]

At that moment, the Blessed One,  
Sumedha, Leader of the World,  
was preaching the Four \[Noble\] Truths,  
enlightening the people then. (35) \[4146\]

Pressing both my hands together  
with[^66] the sandalwood on my head,  
having greeted the Sambuddha,  
I spoke these verses \[to him then\]: (36) \[4147\]

“When jasmine trees[^67] are flowering  
\[their\] scents are diffused around them;[^68]  
Hero, with the scent of virtue you  
permeate every[^69] direction. (37) \[4148\]

When the *sal* trees[^70] are flowering,  
champak,[^71] ironwood,[^72] *vanika*,[^73]  
hiptage vines,[^74] and and \[also\] screw-pine,[^75]  
\[their scents\] get diffused with the wind. (38) \[4149\]

Having smelled your \[perfume-like\] scent,  
I came here from Himalaya.  
I worship you,[^76] O Sage So Great,  
World’s Best One, O One of Great Fame.” (39) \[4150\]

I anointed the World-Leader,  
Sumedha, with good sandalwood.  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart  
I stood silently at that time. (40) \[4151\]

The Blessed One named Sumedha,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly  
spoke these verses \[about me then\]: (41) \[4152\]

“This one who praised my virtues and  
who worshipped me[^77] with sandalwood,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (42) \[4153\]

For twenty-five aeons he is  
going to be a handsome man  
who speaks welcome words, pious[^78]  
\[and\] upright, full of great power.[^79] (43) \[4154\]

In the twenty-sixth aeon he  
will delight in the world of gods.  
A thousand times he’ll be a king,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (44) \[4155\]

Thirty-three times the lord of gods,  
he will exercise divine rule,  
\[and there will be\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (45) \[4156\]

Being fallen from there, this man  
will go on to the human state.  
Bound up with \[his\] good[^80] karma he’s  
going to be Brahma’s kinsman.[^81] (46) \[4157\]

Learned, knowing[^82] \[all\] the mantras,  
a master of the three Vedas,  
endowed with three auspicious marks  
\[will be\] the brahmin, Bāvarī. (47) \[4158\]

Having become that man’s student,  
he’ll be a master of mantras.  
Going up to the Sambuddha,  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,  
having asked \[him\] subtle questions,  
cultivating the straight \[path, he\]  
knowing well all the defilements,  
will reach nirvana, undefiled.” (48-49) \[4159-4160\]

The three fires[^83] are blown out in me;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed;  
knowing well all the defilements,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled. (50) \[4161\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (51) \[4162\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (52) \[4163\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (53) \[4164\]

Thus indeed Venerable Todeyya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Todeyya Thera is finished.

The implication is that they violate others, perhaps as thieves who steal what they discover.

[^7]: *tuṇḍikā* from *ṭuṇḍa*, “beak,” RD: “peckers” and cf. *ahituṇḍika*, snake charmer. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss: *mukharayō*, bold speakers, noisy, foul-mouthed. The implication, whatever the exact meaning, is certainly that they were louts.

[^8]: *arindamo*, lit., “tamer of enemies”

[^9]: *bhate*

[^10]: all the mss. apparently read *balatthe* for *balaṭṭhe*, military officers, royal guard; <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> glosses the term as *balasenaṅga*, “the officers’ branch of the army”

[^11]: reading *niggāhayī* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *niggāhayiŋ*, “I restrained”. The verb means “to hold back,” “restrain” “control” “censure” “rebuke” or “rebuff”

[^24]: or “sword-bearers”: *khaggahatthā*, lit., “those with swords in \[their\] hands”

[^25]: *purisā*. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> takes this with *khaggahatthā*, swordsmen, but the “*<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>a*” as well as the list-like structure of the whole passage lead me to take these as referring to two different classes of people who assembled, in this case swordsmen and “men,” that is (acc. to RD) attendants or waiters.

[^26]: or “tribals,” *luddā*, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss *väddō*

[^27]: *vijitasaṅgāmā*. The repetition of the term opens the possibility that in this verse and the previous one it is used as a qualifier of “hero” and “hunter,” but I follow <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss in treating them as separate classes of people.

[^28]: see n. to \#1, v. 25 \[164\].

[^29]: i.e., showing their rut in their eyes, ears, and genitals. See cty, p. 288.

[^30]: *yodhājīvā*, lit., “those who live as warriors”

[^32]: *khamā*

[^33]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *ukkārūharaṇassa*, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> *ukkaraharaṇassa*, both with the same meaning. I suppose this refers to latrine duty in army camps, or else those who clean up animal feces, but is open to a variety of interpretations (and livelier translations, e.g., “and even shoveling up shit”)

[^34]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *uddhavasaddakaŋ*, “the sound of upper \[pitches?\],” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *udhamasaddakaṃ* (?) and glosses the term *kālam haḍa*, “the sound of trumpets,” which I follow here. Cone says this reading is “probably wrong” and suggests the possibility that the correct reading is *uddhaka*, which RD (and *Abhidānappadiīikā*) defines as a sort of drum

[^35]: reading *koṭṭayantā nipātentā* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *koṭṭentānaŋ nivattantā*, “turning back of the crushers (?)”?

[^36]: *trisūla°*

[^37]: *°konti°*

[^38]: *°mantehi*. Cone, following RD (whose uncertain entry would yield “leather shields”), treats *kontimantehi* as a *tatpurusa* rather than *danda* compound, taking the term as “leather-worker’s sharp knife”. I follow <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> in seeing “mantra” as a kind of injurious weapon, too.

[^39]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reading is considerably different: *kimevāt’ nisāmetvā*, “having observed ‘what now?” (?), a reading it glosses, “having asked, ‘what punishment is appropriate (according to the law)?’”

[^40]: reading *ajitaṃ jino* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> Ajitañjayo, “that king \[named\] Ajitañjaya,” which as noted in the note to v. 1 \[4113\], above, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> rejects (giving Vijaya as the king’s name). But these first two feet are in any event confused and problematic).

[^41]: reading *saddaṃ mānusakā’ kaṃsu* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> (and <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> alt.) for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *saddam amānus’ âkāsuŋ*, “non-humans made (*sic*, taking *akāsuŋ* as 3rd pl. aor. of *karoti* on the model of *akāsi*, 3rd sing. aor; it would more likely come fr. *ākāsati*, i.e., “shined”) the sound”

[^42]: *niraye pa<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">cc</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">chch</span>amānassa*

[^43]: *tuvaṭṭento*, causative, lit., “being made to turn” (as opposed to the indicative sense of the same verb, translated at \[1487\], \[1597\] as “snuggle” and at \[4058\] as “nestle”)

[^44]: this follows the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss “(*men*)”

[^45]: reading *sayāmi* (“I lie down”) with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> (and <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> alt.) for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *vasāmi* (“I am living”). <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> also offers *passāmi* (“I am seeing”) as another alt.

[^46]: *vasāmi niraye*

[^47]: lit., “what \[for me\] with…?”

[^48]: *tomaraṅkusapāṇihi*

[^49]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> presents \[4129\] as a six-footed verses; <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> includes the last two feet of the verse \[4129e-f\] as the first two feet of v. 18 (a-b).

[^50]: *jātiyā, lit*., “well-born” or simply “excellent,” the term connotes lineage, genealogy, caste, breed. Here it seems to substitute for “those fast like the wind” (*vātajavā*) in parallel lists (see above, \[1293\], \[2692\], \[3981\])

[^51]: *gāmaṇīya* usually means elephant-trainers, as in v. 26 \[4097\], above, but here the context makes “horse-trainer” a more suitable translation, so I have taken the same liberty taken by the poet in treating the term that way. PSI indicates that these are trainers of “elephants, etc.” (*ätun ādīn puhuṇu karana ā<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>āryyaya*), allowing for the extended meaning in this context.

[^52]: *sannaddhā*, RD: fastened, bound; put on, clothed (with), armed, accoutred. The term has a wide enough range to leave open the possibility that rather than covered in the hides of these big cats, the poet imagines the chariots pulled by leopards and tigers, which would make sense of the specification below that they are also mounted by animal-trainers, in this case perhaps leopard- and tiger-trainers, paralleling the elephant-trainers who mount the elephants and the horse-trainers who mount the horses.

[^53]: *dīpā*, fr. *dīpī*, leopard. Both RD and PSI give cart covered with a tiger skin as one of the meanings of *dīpā*, and the same (i.e., covered with a tiger skin) for *veyyagghā*, but here the “and also too” (*atho pi*) connecting the two terms clearly indicates that they are not simple synonyms, but rather two types of decorated or armored carts: those covered with leopard skins (*dīpā*) and those covered with tiger skins (*veyyagghā*).

[^54]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> presents this as a six-footed verse; it spans two verses in <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>

[^55]: *sabbā kaŋsūpadhāraṇā*

[^56]: hasulā = ?

[^57]: RD gives “good hips,” referring to this text. I don’t see the warrant, and take the term *susaññā* from *saññā*, sense, perception, as does <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>

[^58]: this is the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> spelling (here as *Bhāgirathi*, sic). <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reads *Bhāgirasī*

[^59]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *agyāgāraŋ*, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> *aggyāgāraṃ*

[^60]: *āraddhaviriyo*

[^61]: *pahitatto*

[^62]: *maṇḍape*

[^63]: *yakkho āsi mahiddhiko*, lit., “a spirit with great *iddhi*”

[^64]: *āsi*, lit., “there was \[for me\]”

[^65]: *saŋviggo*, fr. *saṃvega*

[^66]: lit., “making” “placing”

[^67]: *vassike*

[^68]: *santike*, i.e., in their immediate vicinity

[^69]: contract to ev’ry when chanting, to keep the meter

[^70]: *sālesu*, shorea robusta

[^71]: the *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampaka* (Sinh. *sapu*) tree is *Magnolia champaca*, formerly classified as *michelia champaca*. English names for the tree include Champak, Joy Perfume Tree, Yellow Jade Orchid Tree and Fragrant Himalayan Champaca. It was the Bodhi tree of the seventeenth Buddha of the *Buddhavaṃsa*, Atthadassi. It has highly fragrant cream to yellowish-colored blossoms.

[^72]: *nāga* = Sinhala *nā*, ironwood, Mesua Ferrea Linn, Bodhi tree of Mangala, Sumana, Revata, Sobhita buddhas; national tree of Sri Lanka. It has brilliant, fragrant white flowers containing four petals each, as well as a red fruit eaten by birds.

[^73]: *vanike*, Sinh. gloss *kōmbu*. RD: *vanika* = *vanaka*, of the forest, only in the cpd. *nāgavanika*, = “of the elephant forest,” = a hunter. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> glosses *nāga°* as *nā* (ironwood), so *vanika* here must refer to another kind of flowering plant.

[^74]: *atimuttaka*. RD: a plant, Gaertnera Racemosa = Hiptage, hiptage benghalensis, stout, high-climbing vine, now invasive species in Florida, scented pink-white flowers, medicinal uses. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> glosses Sinh. *yohombu* (Bot. Dict*. = yohombu väla = yon tumba*, an annual creeper, Trichodesma zeylanicum).

[^75]: *ketaka*, Pandanus odoratissima, Sinhala *väṭakē* or *väṭakeyiyā*.

[^76]: lit., “I do *pūjā*”

[^77]: lit., “did *pūjā*”

[^78]: *brahmā* (III)

[^79]: *°patāpavā*

[^80]: *puñña*, lit., “meritorious”

[^81]: i.e., a brahmin by caste

[^82]: lit., “bearing,” *°dharo*

[^83]: the cty here explains these as the fires of *rāga* (lust), *dosa* (anger) and *moha* (ignorance, folly)
