### \[424. {427.}[^1] Ekadhammasavanīya[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
was the Master of Everything.  
\[While\] preaching the Four Noble Truths,  
he ferried many folks across. (1) \[4548\]

A matted-haired ascetic[^3] then,  
I practiced fierce austerities.[^4]  
Throwing off \[my\] clothes made of bark,  
I traveled in the sky back then. (2) \[4549\]

I am not \[then\] able[^5] to go  
over \[him,\] the Best of Buddhas.  
Like a bird that has struck a rock,  
I am unable to proceed.[^6] (3) \[4550\]

Having walked[^7] upon the water,  
so I am flying through the sky.  
Previously my behavior  
never had been interrupted. (4) \[4551\]

“Well now I’ll investigate that.  
I might get some small benefit.”  
Descending from the sky I then  
heard the \[sweet\] sound of the Teacher,  
who was preaching impermanence  
with a voice that was enticing,  
good to listen to, beautiful.  
I took up that \[Teaching\] back then. (5-6) \[4552-4553\]

Having perceived impermanence,[^8]  
I went \[back\] to my hermitage.  
Remaining as long as I lived,  
I \[later\] passed away \[right\] there. (7) \[4554\]

In subsequent existences,  
I recalled hearing the Teaching.[^9]  
Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (8) \[4555\][^10]

For thirty thousand aeons I  
delighted in the world of gods,  
and fifty-one times \[while there\], I  
exercised rule over the gods. (9) \[4556\]

And twenty-one times I was \[then\]  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\].  
\[And I enjoyed\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (10) \[4557\]

I enjoyed \[my\] own good karma,[^11]  
being happy from birth to birth.  
Recalling that perception, I  
transmigrated from birth to birth.  
I do not comprehend the end,[^12]  
nirvana, the eternal state. (11) \[4558\][^13]

Sitting down in my father’s house,  
a monk with senses \[well-\]controlled  
was \[then\] explaining this sermon,[^14]  
spoken about impermanence:[^15] (12) \[4559\]

“In flux indeed is all that is;  
things that arise and \[then\] decline  
are being born \[and then\] dying;  
happy is the relief from them.” (13) \[4560\]

Right after having heard \[that\] verse,  
I recalled my past perception.  
Sitting down on a single seat,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (14) \[4561\]

When \[only\] seven years of age,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.  
The Buddha \[himself\] ordained me:  
the fruit of hearing the Teaching. (15) \[4562\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I heard the Teaching back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of hearing the Teaching. (16) \[4563\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (17) \[4564\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (18) \[4565\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (19) \[4566\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekadhammasavanīya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekadhammasavanīya Thera is finished.
