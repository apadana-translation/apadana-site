### \[330. Saparivārachattadāyaka[^1]\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
was raining down the *Dhamma*-rain  
like the rainwaters from[^2] the sky. (1) \[2907\]

I saw him \[then\], the Sambuddha,  
preaching the path to deathlessness.  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart,  
I \[then\] went back to \[my\] own house. (2) \[2908\]

Taking an adorned umbrella,  
I approached the Ultimate Man.  
Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I lifted it up in the sky. (3) \[2909\]

\[One of\] the foremost followers,  
controlled like a well-built[^3] vehicle,  
going up to the Sambuddha  
\[then\] held \[it\] up over \[his\] head. (4) \[2910\]

\[Full of\] Pity, Compassionate,  
the Buddha, the World’s Chief Leader,  
sitting in the monks’ Assembly,[^4]  
\[then\] spoke these verses \[about me\]: (5) \[2911\]

“He who gave \[me\] this umbrella,  
adorned, delightful to the mind,  
because of that mental pleasure  
will not go to a bad rebirth. (6) \[2912\]

And seven times among the gods  
he will exercise divine rule,  
and thirty-six times he will be  
a \[powerful\] wheel-turning king. (7) \[2913\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (8) \[2914\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (9) \[2915\]

Understanding the Buddha’s speech,  
\[those\] majestic words he uttered,  
happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I gave rise to even more speech. (10) \[2916\]

Abandoning the human womb,  
I attained the womb of a god.  
My superb heavenly mansion  
rose up tall,[^5] delighting the mind. (11) \[2917\]

When I go out from \[that\] mansion,  
a white umbrella is carried.[^6]  
I am getting that perception:  
the fruit of previous karma. (12) \[2918\]

Falling from the world of the gods  
I came into the human state,  
thirty-six times a wheel-turner,  
seven hundred aeons ago. (13) \[2919\]

After falling from that body,  
I went on to the Thirty-Three.[^7]  
Transmigrating I by and by  
came back again to human \[life\]. (14) \[2920\]

They carried a white umbrella  
for me leaving \[my\] mother’s womb.  
\[Then\] at the age of seven years,  
I went forth into homelessness. (15) \[2921\]

\[There was a man\] named Sunanda,[^8]  
a brahmin master of mantras.  
Bringing a crystal[^9] umbrella  
, gifted the chief follower. (16) \[2922\]

The great hero, the great speaker  
Sāriputta expressed \[his\] thanks.[^10]  
Hearing his expression of thanks,  
I recalled my previous deed. (17) \[2923\]

Pressing both my hands together,  
I brought pleasure to \[my\] own heart.  
Remembering \[my\] past karma,  
I attained the arahant-state. (18) \[2924\]

Then standing up from \[my\] seat, I —  
hands pressed together on \[my\] head —  
saluted \[him,\] the Sambuddha,  
\[and\] uttered these words \[at that time\]: (19) \[2925\]

“One hundred thousand aeons hence  
Padumuttara the Buddha,  
World Knower, Unmatched in the World,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the Self-Become One, Chief Person,  
did take up in both of his hands  
the umbrella given by me,  
all-adorned and decorated. (20-21) \[2926-2927\]

O! the Buddha! O! the Teaching!  
O! Our Teacher’s accomplishment!  
Through the gift of one umbrella,  
I was reborn in no bad state. (22) \[2928\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
knowing well all the defilements,  
without defilements I \[now\] live. (23)
\[2929\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (24) \[2930\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saparivārachattadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Saparivārachattadāyaka Thera is finished.
