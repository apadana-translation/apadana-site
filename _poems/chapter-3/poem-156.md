*\[156. Kadambapupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named Kukkuṭa.[^2]  
At the foot of that \[same\] mountain,  
seven \[Lonely\] Buddhas dwelt \[then\].[^3] (1) \[2022\]

Seeing a kadam \[tree\] in bloom,  
like the risen king of \[all\] lamps,[^4]  
taking \[blossoms\] with both \[my\] hands  
I placed them upon the Buddhas. (2) \[2023\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did that flower-*pūjā* \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2024\]

In the ninety-second aeon  
seven \[named\] Phullanāyaka[^5]  
were wheel-turning kings with great strength,  
possessors of the seven gems. (4) \[2025\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2026\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kadambapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kadambapupphiya Thera is finished.
