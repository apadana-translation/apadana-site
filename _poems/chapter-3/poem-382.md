*\[379. {382.}*[^1] *Labujaphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
In the city, Bandhumatī,  
I worked in a hermitage then.[^3]  
I saw the Buddha, Spotless One,  
\[who\] was traveling through the sky. (1) \[3284\]

Taking fruit of a breadfruit[^4] \[tree\]  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha.  
Standing in the sky, the Calm One,  
the Great Famed One accepted \[it\]. (2) \[3285\]

Having given Buddha that fruit,  
with a mind that was very clear,  
productive of delight for me,  
bringing happiness in this world,  
I then came to possess great joy  
and vast, ultimate happiness.  
A gem[^5] was truly produced for  
\[me,\] being reborn here and there.[^6] (3-4) \[3286-3287\][^7]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[the Buddha\] fruit back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (5) \[3288\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[3289\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (7) \[3290\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[3291\]

Thus indeed Venerable Labujaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Labujaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Breadfruit Fruit Donor.” BJTS omits *phala* from the name.  
[^3]: *ārāmika,* lit., “hermitage attendant” or “hermitage dweller”  
[^4]: Artocarpus lacucha or incisa; Sinh. *del.* The fruit of the tree
    is cooked and eaten as a starchy vegetable.  
[^5]: perhaps implying a wish-fulfilling gem, or else a gem of great
    value that could fund all needs (effectively, the same thing)  
[^6]: lit., “from where to there” (*yahiŋ tahiŋ*, PTS) or “from there to
    there” (*tahiṃ tahiṃ,* BJTS and PTS alt.)  
[^7]: PTS treats these as two verses of six feet each; BJTS treats them
    as three typical four-footed verses. BJTS is presumably correct,
    since the parallel *apadāna, *
