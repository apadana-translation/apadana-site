*\[414. {417.}*[^1] *Ucchaṅgapupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
In the city, Bandhumatī,  
I was a gardener back then.  
Having filled \[my\] lap[^3] \[with flowers,\]  
I went[^4] to the bazaar \[with them\]. (1) \[4409\]  
The Buddha[^5] in that period,  
Honored by the monks’ Assembly,  
the World-Leader, was going by,[^6]  
through \[his\] enormous majesty.[^7] (2) \[4410\]  
Having seen the Lamp of the World,  
Vipassi, Crosser of the World,  
taking a flower from my lap,  
I offered[^8] \[it\] to Best Buddha. (3) \[4411\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I offered[^9] a flower \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[4412\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[4413\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4414\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4415\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Ucchaṅgapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ucchaṅgapupphiya Thera is finished.
