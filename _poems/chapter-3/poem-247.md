*\[247. Dhātupūjaka*[^1]*\]*

When Siddhattha, the Best of Men,

the World’s Lord, reached nirvana,

I received a single relic

of the Biped Lord, Neutral One. (1) \[2484\]

I, having taken that relic

of the Buddha, the Sun’s Kinsman,

did \[then\] worship \[it\] for five years

as though the Best of Men stood[^2] \[there\]. (2) \[2485\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I worshipped that relic back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

the fruit of caring for relics. (3) \[2486\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2487\]

Thus indeed Venerable Dhātupūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Dhātupūjaka Thera is finished.
