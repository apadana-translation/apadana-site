### \[56. Saparivārāsana[^1]\]

I gave alms-food which was begged for  
to Padumuttara Buddha.  
Going to the place where he ate,  
\[I\] scattered jasmine flowers \[there\]. (1) \[1300\]

Seated on that seat, the Buddha,  
the Top Leader of the \[Whole\] World,  
the Upright \[and\] Attentive One  
praised that alms-food which was begged for. (2) \[1301\]

“Just as even a little seed  
\[when\] planted in a fertile field  
will bear completely when it rains[^2]  
fruit that brings the plowman delight, (3) \[1302\]

so too this alms-food which was begged,  
planted in a good field by you;  
When \[you’re\] reborn in existence  
you will be pleased with the fruit \[then\].”[^3] (4) \[1303\]

Having said this, the Sambuddha  
whose name was that of the lotus,  
extolling alms-food which is begged,  
\[then\] departed facing the north. (5) \[1304\]

Self-controlled in the monks’ precepts[^4]  
and in the five organs of sense,  
being one bound to solitude  
I’m living without defilements. (6) \[1305\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1306\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saparivārāsana Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Saparivārāsana Thera is finished.
