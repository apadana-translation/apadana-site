*\[92. Sucintita*[^1]*\]*

Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,

I gave a \[new\] auspicious chair[^2]

to Tissa the Lord of the World,

the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun. (1) \[1560\]

Eight and thirty aeons ago

I was the king, Mahāruci.

There were lots of riches \[for me\]

and many beds \[to sit upon\]. (2) \[1561\]

Having given Buddha a chair

with a mind that was very clear,

I experienced my own karma

well-done by myself formerly. (3) \[1562\]

In the ninety-two aeons since

I gifted \[him\] that chair back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of a chair-gift. (4) \[1563\]

Eight and thirty aeons ago

there were three wheel-turning monarchs:

Ruci and Uparuci too,

\[and\] Mahāruci was the third. (5) \[1564\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1565\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sucintita Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sucintita Thera is finished

[^1]: “Well-Thought.” \#66 and \#425 {428} are also ascribed to
    (apparently different) monks of this name.

[^2]: reading *suddhāpīṭham* (BJTS, PTS alt.) for *pubbe-pīṭham*
    (“former \[or eastern\] chair,” PTS).
