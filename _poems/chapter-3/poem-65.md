### \[65. Bhisadāyaka[^1]\]

The \[Sambuddha\] named Vessabhu,  
the third Sage \[born in that aeon,\][^2]  
plunging[^3] into a forest grove  
lived \[there\], the Ultimate Person. (1) \[1377\]

Taking \[some\] lotus roots and stems,[^4]  
I[^5] went into Buddha’s presence  
and gave that \[food\] to the Buddha  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[my\] own hands. (2) \[1378\]

And feeling the touch of the hand  
of Vessabhu the One Most Wise,  
I was happy beyond compare;  
could anything ever top that?[^6] (3) \[1379\]

My final \[life\] is taking place;  
all existence is \[now\] destroyed.  
When I was an elephant king  
I planted wholesome \[seeds back then\]. (4) \[1380\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a lotus root. (5) \[1381\]

In the thirteenth aeon \[ago\]  
there were sixteen lords of people,  
kings \[all known as\] Samodhāna  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (6) \[1382\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1383\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bhisadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bhisadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Lotus-root Donor”

[^2]: this follows <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss and the cty, which explains that Vessabhu was born in that aeon \[thirty-one aeons ago\] after Vipassi and then Sikhi

[^3]: reading *ogayha* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) for *oggayha* (<abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>). Cty also reads *oggayha*, but glosses it with the proper gerund (*ogahetvā*), which it clarifies to mean “he entered” (*pāvisi*).

[^4]: *bhisa* refers to the lotus root or “potato” (Sinh. *ala*) found under the mud; *muḷāla* refers to the lotus “stem” (Sinh. *daṇḍu*, dictionary gives *däli*). The former is starchy and crunchy; the latter is like a green vegetable. Both are delicious staples of village diets to this day.

[^5]: the cty explains that he had been born in an elephant’s womb at that time. Cf. v. \[1380\], below.

[^6]: this rather loose translation follows the Sinhala gloss. The last two pādas would literally be: “I was happy, I didn’t experience the same \[happiness before\], beyond that what would be?”
