### \[117. Buddhasaññaka[^1]\]

When Vipassi, Top of the World,  
abandoned life’s constituents,  
the land, engirdled in water,  
the \[very\] earth, did quake \[back then\]. (1) \[1733\]

When the Buddha’s life was finished  
my dwelling was also shaken.  
\[And\] my ornamental hair-wreath  
was stretched and pulled \[apart by that\]. (2) \[1734\]

When my residence was shaken,  
I was terrified \[to feel it\].  
And for whatever reason \[then\]  
there was a vast effulgence \[there\]. (3) \[1735\]

Vessavaṇa[^2] having come here,  
dispelled \[the fears of\] the people:  
“There’s nothing for beings to fear;  
be calm, exercise self-control. (4) \[1736\]

O! the Buddha! O! the Teaching!  
O! our Teacher’s \[great\] achievement!  
\[Also\] when he was being born  
the earth \[itself\] did quake \[back then\].” (5) \[1737\]

After \[he\] praised Buddha’s power,  
I thrilled an aeon in heaven.  
During the remaining aeons  
I did \[lots of\] wholesome karma. (6) \[1738\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I obtained that perception then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of perceiving Buddha. (7) \[1739\]

In the fourteenth aeon ago,  
I was a majestic monarch,  
known by the name of Samita,  
a wheel-turner with great power. (8) \[1740\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1741\]

Thus indeed Venerable Buddhasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Buddhasaññaka Thera is finished.
