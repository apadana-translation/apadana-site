*Subhūti Chapter, the Third*  
*\[21. Subhūti\]*  
Close to the Himalayan range  
\[on\] the mountain called Nisabha  
my ashram is very well made,  
a well-constructed hall of leaves. (1) \[813\]

Famed ascetic with matted hair,  
Kosiya was \[my\] name \[back then\].  
Solitary, with no second,  
I did live on Nisabha then. (2) \[814\]

At that time I was not eating  
fruits and roots and \[freshly-picked\] leaves.  
I was always subsisting on  
the stuff[^1] that fell into my bowl. (3) \[815\]

I disturbed no mode of living,  
giving up \[my own\] life itself.  
My own heart was satisfied as  
I rejected \[all\] harmful ways. (4) \[816\]

Whenever there arose in me  
a mind heated up by passion,  
reflecting on it by myself,  
remaining calm I would tame it: (5) \[817\]

“You’re aroused in what’s arousing,  
you are defiled in what defiles,  
you fool yourself in foolish things  
\[so\] you should leave the forest \[now\]. (6) \[818\]

This is the habitation of  
the pure \[and\] stainless ascetics.  
Do not sully that purity;  
you ought to leave the forest \[now\]. (7) \[819\]

Having become a homeless one,  
you always get what is fitting.  
Don’t you transgress against them both;  
you ought to leave the forest \[now\]. (8) \[820\]

The wood left from a funeral pyre  
is not made use of anywhere:  
in the village or the jungle  
it’s not approved as firewood. (9) \[821\]

You are just like that firebrand,  
neither layman nor \[yet\] wise man.  
Today you’ve departed from both  
\[so\] you should leave the forest \[now\]. (10) \[822\]

What then would that produce for you?  
To what does this give birth for you?  
Giving up[^2] my practice of faith  
results in so much idleness. (11) \[823\]

The wise are going to despise you  
as a householder \[dislikes\] dirt.[^3]  
Sages, having rooted \[you\] out  
will always cast blame upon you. (12) \[824\]

The wise ones will speak out against  
you leaving the dispensation.  
You’ll receive no co-residence;  
what are you going to live on \[then\]? (13) \[825\]

A strong elephant will approach  
an elephant who’s thrice-rutting,[^4]  
a tusker sixty years of age  
and drive him away from the herd. (14) \[826\]

Living in exile from the herd  
he’s not happy nor is he pleased.  
Suffering with \[his\] mind depressed,  
full of remorse, he will tremble.[^5] (15) \[827\]

Just like that the cruel ascetics  
are \[surely\] going to throw you out.  
Being exiled by them you won’t  
feel happiness or pleasure \[then\]. (16) \[828\]

If by day or by night you are  
pierced through with the arrow of grief,  
\[then\] you will burn with pain just like  
the tusker exiled from the herd. (17) \[829\]

Just as a pretty iron tool  
is not taken out[^6] anywhere,  
so you, without moral restraint,  
won’t be invited anywhere. (18) \[830\]

Even if you’re dwelling at home  
what are you going to live on \[there\]?  
You do not have a heap of wealth[^7]  
from your mother and \[your\] father. (19) \[831\]

Having done \[hard\] work by oneself  
\[much\] sweat flows out of the body.  
Thus earning a living at home,  
you won’t think it \[so\] excellent.”[^8] (20) \[832\]

In that way I carried on there  
\[whenever\] my mind was defiled.  
Making varied *Dhamma-*speeches  
I warded off my evil heart. (21) \[833\]

While I was living in this way  
dwelling \[so\] very thoughtfully  
\[fully\] thirty thousand years passed  
in my forest \[hermitage there\]. (22) \[834\]

Seeing my love of thoughtfulness  
\[in\] seeking \[for\] the supreme goal,  
Padumuttara the Buddha  
\[then\] came to the place where I was. (23) \[835\]

The Bright Hue of Wild Mangosteen,[^9]  
Incomparable,[^10] Unmeasurable,[^11]  
the Buddha, Unrivaled in Form,[^12]  
walked back and forth \[across\] the sky.[^13] (24) \[836\]

Like a regal *sal* tree in bloom,  
like lightening inside of a cloud,  
the Buddha, Peerless in Knowledge,  
walked back and forth \[across\] the sky. (25) \[837\]

Not frightened, like the king of beasts;  
prideful like an elephant-king;  
playful as a tiger-king he  
walked back and forth \[across\] the sky. (26) \[838\]

Shining like a coin[^14] made of gold  
\[or even\] like glowing embers,  
like a wish-fulfilling gem[^15] he  
walked back and forth \[across\] the sky. (27) \[839\]

Like Mount Kailās[^16] in purity,  
like the moon on the fifteenth day,[^17]  
like the \[blazing\] midday sun he  
walked back and forth \[across\] the sky. (28) \[840\]

Seeing him walk across the sky  
at that time I thought in this way:  
“Is this creature some sort of god?  
If not, is this one \[just\] a man? (29) \[841\]

I’ve never heard of nor have seen  
a man as great as this one \[seems\].  
Surely he knows \[secret\] mantras;  
\[I think\] this must be the Teacher.” (30) \[842\]

Having thought about it like that  
I brought pleasure to \[my\] own heart.  
And I then gathered together  
various flowers and perfumes. (31) \[843\]

Spreading out a seat of flowers  
I \[then\] spoke these words \[to Buddha\],  
Good-Hearted One, the Mind’s Delight,  
the Charioteer of Men, the Top: (32) \[844\]

“O Hero, I’ve spread out this seat  
which is a fitting one for you.  
Bringing laughter to my \[own\] heart  
please sit on this seat of flowers.” (33) \[845\]

The Blessed One did sit down there  
unfrightened like a lion\[-king\],  
\[and\] the Buddha \[remained\] a week  
on that excellent floral seat. (34) \[846\]

Worshipping \[him\] I stood \[right there\]  
for \[all\] those seven nights and days.  
Rising up from meditation  
the Teacher, Best One in the World, (35) \[847\]

declaring my karmic \[result\]  
\[then\] did speak these words \[to me there\]:  
“Practice Buddha-recollection,[^18]  
\[it’s\] the supreme meditation. (36) \[848\]

Cultivating this mindfulness  
will be fulfilling mentally.  
For thirty thousand aeons you  
will delight in the world of gods. (37) \[849\]

Eighty times as the king of gods  
you will exercise divine rule.  
A thousand times you’re going to be  
wheel-turning king of a country. (38) \[850\]

\[And you will have\] much local rule  
innumerable by counting.  
You’ll experience all of that:  
fruit of Buddha-recollection. (39) \[851\]

Transmigrating from birth to birth  
you will receive many riches.  
In wealth never deficiency:  
fruit of Buddha-recollection. (40) \[852\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (41) \[853\]

Discarding eight hundred million  
\[and\] many slaves \[and\] workers \[too\],  
you’ll renounce in the great Teaching  
of Gotama the Blessed One. (42) \[854\]

Satisfying the Sambuddha,  
Gotama, the Bull of Śākyas,  
you will be known as Subhūti,  
a follower of the Teacher. (43) \[855\]

Seated in the \[monks’\] assembly  
he’ll fix you in two foremost spots:  
in the group of gift-receivers,  
and also of forest-dwellers.” (44) \[856\]

Having said this, the Sambuddha  
who was named for the lotus flower,  
the Hero[^19] flew into the sky  
just like a swan-king in the air. (45) \[857\]

\[Thus\] instructed by the World-Chief  
\[and\] having praised the Thus-Gone-One,  
satisfied I always practiced  
supreme Buddha-recollection. (46) \[858\]

Due to that karma done very well  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (47) \[859\]

Eighty times as the king of gods  
I did exercise divine rule,  
and \[too\] a thousand times I was  
a wheel-turning monarch \[then\]. (48) \[860\]

\[And I did have\] much local rule  
innumerable by counting.  
I experienced supreme success:  
fruit of Buddha-recollection. (49) \[861\]

Transmigrating from birth to birth  
I did receive many riches.  
In wealth never deficiency:  
fruit of Buddha-recollection. (50) \[862\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I performed that \[good\] karma,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
fruit of Buddha-recollection. (51) \[863\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (52) \[864\]

Thus indeed Venerable Subhūti Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Subhūti Thera is finished.

[^1]: I am unclear how to take paṇḍu (“yellowish”) in this compound. The cty understands it to mean leaves that fell from trees by themselves, and this would correspond to the usage of *paṇḍu* as “withered” in some compounds, but I leave it ambiguous, as is the Pali.

[^2]: reading *jahasi* (“giving up,” “abandoning,” BJTS) for *pāhisi* (“sent,” PTS)

[^3]: or “shit,” *asuciṃ* = impurity, excrement. Is “shit” too strong a word for a translation of *Apadān*a? Does “*asuci*” carry that strong a connotation? Does “dirt” carry a strong enough one?

[^4]: i.e., showing their rut in their eyes, ears, and genitals. See cty, p. 288.

[^5]: reading *pajjhāyanto pavadheti* (BJTS) for *ojjhāyanto padhāvat*i (PTS).

[^6]: the texts disagree on the reading of this verb, which undergirds the analogy between the failed ascetic and the iron tool (*kūṭaṃ*, a kind of hammer); it is in the 3rd person here, and the 2nd person in the fourth foot. I follow PTS but read the verb *yāyati* rather loosely to mean both “taken out for use” (as in the hammer) and “taken out for a meal” (as in the ascetic); the verb itself just means “go”. In this reading, the beauty (*jātarūpa*) of the tool would be the reason it isn’t taken out/used, and would imply that like that the ascetic looks good but isn’t actually useful. The alternative *jhāyati* (“meditates,” PTS alt.) would compare the failed ascetic to an insentient thing, which is also possible, though it’s not then clear why the text stipulates that it’s a beautiful hammer. The BJTS reading is *jhāpeti*, “set on fire,” “reduce to ashes;” while it is true that the iron hammer wouldn’t burn, it’s not clear what this would mean vis-a-vis the ascetic (who, we’re told in v. \[17\], *will* be burning), unless it be that no one would perform his funeral. The PTS reading *yāyati* is especially to be preferred given the focus on place in *kattha ci* (“anywhere,” repeated in the second and fourth feet).

[^7]: *nicitaṃ dhanaṃ*, the PTS reading.The BJTS (and PTS alt) reading is *nihitaṃ dhanaṃ* “renounced wealth,” in which case the translation would be: “you do not have the maternal and paternal wealth which you renounced.”

[^8]: lit., “it will not be liked by you as excellent”

[^9]: lit., “radiant with the color of a *Timbarūsaka* \[tree\]”. The tree is *d*iospyros embryopteris, Sinh. *timbiri.* The cty. specifies that the color is that of gold.

[^10]: *anupamo*

[^11]: *appameyyo*

[^12]: *rūpen’asadiso*

[^13]: lit., he walked back and forth in the sky at that time.” I have ignored the tadā in most of the instances of this repeated phrase, *metri causa.*

[^14]: *siṅgī-nikkha-suvaṇṇa-ābbho; nikkha* can also be an ornament, or a weight, The thrust, anyway, is that the Buddha was shiny like gold.

[^15]: *jotirasa,* Pali-Sinhala-Ingirīsi dictionary calls it a wishing jewel, *cintāmāṇikyaya*, i.e., a gem that grants wishes.

[^16]: reading *visuddha-kelāsa-nibho* (BJTS) for *visuddha-kelāsa-ṇ-ṇibho* (PTS).

[^17]: i.e., when it is full, *puṇṇamāse va candimā*

[^18]: *buddhanussati*

[^19]: BJTS (and PTS alt.) reads *dhīro* (“the wise one”)
