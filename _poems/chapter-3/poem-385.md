*\[382. {385.}*[^1] *Phārusaphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
I gave *phārusa*[^3] fruit \[back then\]  
to the Gold Colored Sambuddha,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
who was going along the road. (1) \[3303\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave that fruit \[to the Buddha\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (2) \[3304\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3305\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[3306\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[3307\]

Thus indeed Venerable Phārusaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Phārusaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “*Phārusa* Fruit Donor.”  
[^3]: a fruit from which a drink is made, Sinh. *boraḷu-damunu.* BJTS
    equates it with *ugurässa,* Flacourtia Ramontchi, sweet lovi lovi,
    but RD says it is a bitter fruit. Bot. Dictionary says that
    *boraḷu-damunu* is a species of Eugenia.
