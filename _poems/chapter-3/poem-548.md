### \[545. {548.}[^1] Lomasakaṅgiya[^2]\]

In this \[present\] lucky aeon  
Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,  
known by the name of Kassapa,[^3]  
Best Debater,[^4] \[Buddha,\] arose. (1) \[6247\]

Back then \[both\] <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andana and I,  
gone forth[^5] in the dispensation,  
fulfilling *Dhamma* to the end  
of life in the dispensation, (2) \[6248\]

fallen from there were both reborn  
\[as gods\] in Tusitā heaven.  
Having surpassed the others[^6] there,  
through dances which were divine, and  
through songs \[and\] through speeches and the  
ten attainments starting with looks,  
living \[our\] lifespan’s \[full\] extent,  
we’re enjoying great happiness. (3-4) \[6249-6250\]

Falling from there, <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andana was  
reborn among the thirty \[gods\];  
I was a son of the Śākyas,[^7]  
in Kapilavastu city. (5) \[6251\]

When \[the Buddha\], the World’s Leader,  
asked by the Elder, Udāyi,[^8]  
with compassion for the Śākyas  
returned[^9] to Kapilavastu, (6) \[6252\]

the proud among the Śākyans then,  
not knowing the Buddha’s virtue,  
aren’t bowing to the Sambuddha,  
caste-conceited,[^10] disrespectful.[^11] (7) \[6253\]

Discerning what they were thinking,  
walking back and forth in the sky,  
the Victor rained like the Rain-God,[^12]  
\[and\] blazed forth like the God of Fire.[^13] (8) \[6254\]

Displaying his unequaled form,  
he made \[it\] disappear again.  
Having been one, he was many,  
\[and then\] again he was alone. (9) \[6255\]

He showed \[himself\] in varied forms,  
in darkness as well as bright light.  
Having performed that miracle,  
the Sage instructed \[his\] kinsmen. (10) \[6256\]

A huge cloud four continents\[-wide\]  
rained forth \[on the world\] all the time.  
Then the Buddha preached \[to them all\]  
the *Vessantara Jātaka*.[^14] (11) \[6257\]

At that time all those kṣatriyans,  
having slain \[their\] caste-born conceit,  
approached the Buddha for refuge.  
Then \[King\] Suddhodana[^15] said this: (12) \[6258\]

“O Very Wise One[^16] this is the third time I’m  
worshipping your feet, One with Eyes on All Sides;[^17]  
\[the first time was\] when \[your\] birth caused the earth to quake,  
\[next\] when the rose-apple’s shade did not leave you.”[^18] (13) \[6259\][^19]

Seeing the Buddha’s majestic  
power,[^20] I \[too\] was astonished.[^21]  
Having gone forth right on that spot,  
I dwelt, worshipped by \[my\] mother.[^22] (14) \[6260\]

<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andana, \[now\] son of a god,  
approached me, then examined[^23] \[me\]  
on the *Bhaddekaratta Sutta*,[^24]  
in abridged \[and\] extended forms.[^25] (15) \[6261\]

Then being incited by him,  
I approached the Leader of Men.[^26]  
Hearing the *Bhaddekaratta*,  
moved,[^27] I longed for the forest\[-life\]. (16) \[6262\]

Then I asked \[my\] mother \[about\]  
going alone to the forest.  
My mother said, “You’re Delicate.  
Refrain from that \[course\].”[^28] Then I said: (17) \[6263\]

“\[When\] I’m practicing solitude,[^29]  
I will push away with \[my\] chest  
sacrificial grass[^30] \[and\] cane grass,[^31]  
cuscus grass,[^32] tender grass,[^33] coarse grass.[^34] (18) \[6264\]

Gone into the woods, recalling  
the Victor’s dispensation, the  
advice \[in\] *Bhaddekaratta*,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (19) \[6265\]

The past is not to be pursued;  
the future's not to be longed for.  
What is past has been left behind,  
and the future is unattained. (20) \[6266\]

Everywhere[^35] he who sees clearly  
a thing which arises \[then falls\],  
that wise one[^36] fosters[^37] \[nirvana\],  
unconquerable \[and\] steady. (21) \[6267\]

\[Now,\] today[^38] effort should be made;[^39]  
who knows[^40] \[if there’s\] death tomorrow?  
There exists no contract for us[^41]  
with the massive army of Death. (22) \[6268\]

“Living thus, making great effort,  
day and night, without laziness,  
that indeed’s *Bhaddekaratto*,”  
\[so\] says[^42] the Sage, the Peaceful One.”[^43] (23) \[6269\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (24) \[6270\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (25) \[6271\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (26) \[6272\]

Thus indeed Venerable Lomasakaṅgiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Lomasakaṅgiya Thera is finished.
