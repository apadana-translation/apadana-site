*\[323. Hāsajanaka*[^1]*\]*  
I saw the Teacher’s robe of rags,  
stuck up in the top of a tree.[^2]  
Having pressed my hands together,  
I lifted \[it\] up further still. (1) \[2837\]  
Having glimpsed \[it\] from far away  
\[that robe\] filled me up with laughter.[^3]  
Having pressed my hands together,  
I brought \[my\] heart more pleasure still. (2) \[2838\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I obtained that perception then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of perceiving Buddhas. (3) \[2839\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2840\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Hāsajanaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Hāsajanaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Laughter-Knower”  
[^2]: I follow the cty and BJTS Sinhala gloss in taking *dumagge* as
    *duma + agge*. It would also be possible to take it as *du+ magge*,
    “on a bad road”.  
[^3]: lit., “laughter was produced for me”
