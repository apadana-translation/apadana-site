## Padumukkhepa Chapter, the Twenty-Seventh

### \[261. Ākāsukkhipiya[^1]\]

Taking two water-born flowers,[^2]  
I approached the Bull Among Men,  
Siddhattha, gold-colored \[Buddha\],  
traveling around the bazaar. (1) \[2540\]

I placed one flower down at the  
two feet of the Best of Buddhas.  
And taking the other[^3] flower  
I threw \[it\] up into the sky. (2) \[2541\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I offered that flower \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving flowers. (3) \[2542\]

In the thirty-second aeon  
ago lived one lord of the earth  
known as Antalikkhacara,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (4) \[2543\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances;  
six special knowledges mastered:  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2544\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ākāsukkhipiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ākāsukkhipiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Sky-Scatterer” or “Thrown Up Into the Sky”. The name of each Chapter usually corresponds to the proper name of the subject of the first *apadāna* in it. The same is only partly true here. While the chapter name, *paduma-ukkhepa* (“Pink Lotus Thrown Upward”), alludes both linguistically and descriptively to the name of the Thera, it is not, in fact, his proper name.

[^2]: *jalajagge duve gayhā*. This follows the cty, which explains: *jale udake jāte agge uppalādayo dve pupphe gahetvā* (“taking two flowers such as lotus, the best ones, born in the water”)

[^3]: lit., “and one”

[^4]: “Atmosphere-Wanderer”
