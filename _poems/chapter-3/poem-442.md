*\[439. {442.}*[^1] *Koladāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
I was dressed in[^3] deer-leather \[then,\]  
wearing garments made out of bark.  
Carrying a *khāri* load, I  
brought jujubes[^4][]{#BookmarkCopy1 .anchor} to the ashram. (1)
\[4724\]  
At that time the Buddha, Sikhi,  
was alone with nobody else.[^5]  
He \[then\] approached my hermitage,  
shining brightly all of the time. (2) \[4725\]  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart,  
worshipping[^6] the Compliant One,[^7]  
taking \[them\] with both of my hands  
I gave the Buddha jujubes. (3) \[4726\]  
In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave that fruit \[to him\] back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of giving jujubes. (4) \[4727\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[4728\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4729\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4730\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Koladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Koladāyaka Thera is finished.
