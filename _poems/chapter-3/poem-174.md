*\[174. Udapānadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
For Vipassi, the Blessed One  
I constructed a \[water\] well.  
Having given alms-food \[to him\]  
I dedicated \[the well\] then. (1) \[2121\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of \[giving\] wells. (2) \[2122\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2123\]

Thus indeed Venerable Udapānadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Udapānadāyaka Thera is finished.
