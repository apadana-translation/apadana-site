### \[459. {462.}[^1] <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itapūjaka[^2]\]

When the Buddha[^3] was being burned,  
Sikhi, the Kinsman of the World,  
I offered the funeral pyre  
eight \[sweet-smelling\] champak flowers. (1) \[4869\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I presented that flower \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of worshipping[^4] pyres. (2) \[4870\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4871\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4872\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4873\]

Thus indeed Venerable <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>itapūjaka Thera is finished.
