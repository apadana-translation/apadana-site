*\[100. Buddhūpaṭṭhāka\]*  
\[Back then\] I was the conch-blower  
for Vipassi, the Blessed One,  
constantly engaged in service  
to the Well-Gone One, the Great Sage. (1) \[1606\]

Look at the fruit of that service  
to the Neutral One, the World-Chief:  
sixty thousand *turiya-*drums  
are constantly attending me. (2) \[1607\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I served the Great Sage in that way,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of doing service. (3) \[1608\]

In the twenty-fourth[^1] aeon hence  
there were sixteen \[different\] kings \[then\];  
\[all\] were named Mahānigghosa,[^2]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (4) \[1609\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1610\]

Thus indeed Venerable Buddhūpaṭṭhāka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Buddhūpaṭṭhāka Thera is finished.  
The Summary:  
Sudhāpiṇḍa and Cela too,  
Kammāra, Gandhamāliya,  
Tipupphiya, Madhu, Senā,  
Veyyāvacca and Dhammaka:  
exactly sixty verses are  
related in this chapter.  
The Sudhā[^3] Chapter, the Tenth.  
Then there is the Summary of Chapters:  
Buddha Chapter is the first,  
Sīhāsani, Subhūti,  
Kuṇḍa-Dhāna and Upāli,  
Vījani and Sakacittani,  
Nāgasamāla, Timira,  
with Sudhā Chapter they are ten.  
There are fourteen hundred verses  
plus another fifty-five.  
The Ten Chapters called Buddha.  
The First Hundred[^4] is finished.  
[^1]: reading *catuviise* (BJTS) for *catunavute* (“ninety-four,” PTS)  
[^2]: “Much Sound”  
[^3]: BJTS read “Sudhāpiṇḍiya Chapter”.  
[^4]: *sataka* is a common structure in Sanskrit and Pāli poetry,
    usually referring to one hundred verses, rather than (as here) one
    hundred stories.
