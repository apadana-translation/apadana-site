### \[356. {359.}[^1] Saraṇāgamaniya[^2]\]

We boarded a boat at that time,  
monk and I,[^3] an *ajīvaka*.  
When the boat was broken \[to bits,\]  
that Buddhist monk gave me refuge. (1) \[3173\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
he gave refuge to me \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of going for refuge. (2) \[3174\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3175\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saraṇāgamaniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Saraṇāgamaniya Thera is finished.
