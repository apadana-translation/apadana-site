*\[356. {359.}*[^1] *Saraṇāgamaniya*[^2]*\]*  
We boarded a boat at that time,  
monk and I,[^3] an *ajīvaka.*  
When the boat was broken \[to bits,\]  
that Buddhist monk gave me refuge. (1) \[3173\]  
In the thirty-one aeons since  
he gave refuge to me \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of going for refuge. (2) \[3174\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3175\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Saraṇāgamaniya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Saraṇāgamaniya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Refuge-Goer,” cf. \#23, \#113, \#298; the same text is repeated
    verbatim (except for the addition of the first two verses of the
    standard three-verse concluding refrain, omitted here), with the
    same title, as \#520 {523}, below.  
[^3]: BJTS reads *vahaṃ* (“the current”)
