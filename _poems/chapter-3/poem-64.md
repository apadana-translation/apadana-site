*\[64. Parappasādaka*[^1]*\]*

“Who is not pleased after seeing

the Bull, the Best One, the Hero,

the Sage So Great, Victorious One,

the Golden-Colored Sambuddha? (1) \[1368\]

Who is not pleased after seeing

the Buddha’s meditative states,[^2]

boundless as the Himalayas,

as hard to cross as the ocean? (2) \[1369\]

Who is not pleased after seeing

the Buddha’s moral discipline,

as boundless as the earth itself,

diverse wreath of forest-flowers? (3) \[1370\]

Who is not pleased after seeing

the knowledge Buddha possesses,

unagitated like the sky,

as unfathomable as space?” (4) \[1371\]

Having extolled the Best Buddha,

Siddhattha, the Unconquered One,

with these four verses \[when I was\]

the brahmin whose name was Yena,[^3] (5) \[1372\]

I was reborn in no ill-state

for four and ninety aeons \[thence\];

I enjoyed no small quantity

of happiness in good rebirths. (6) \[1373\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I praised the Leader of the World,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of praising \[him\]. (7) \[1374\]

In the fourteenth aeon ago

there were four \[men named\] Uggata,[^4]

wheel-turning kings with great power,

possessors of the seven gems. (8) \[1375\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1376\]

Thus indeed Venerable Parappasādaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Parappasādaka Thera is finished.
