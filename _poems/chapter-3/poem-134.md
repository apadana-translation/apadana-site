### \[134. Pupphachadanīya[^1]\]

The brahmin known as Sunanda[^2]  
who was a master of the mantras,  
a learned man, fit for begging,  
sacrificed a *vājapeyya*.[^3] (1) \[1895\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
the Top, Compassionate, the Sage,  
having pity for the people,  
walked back and forth across the sky. (2) \[1896\]

Having walked \[thus\] the Sambuddha,  
Omniscient One, the World-Leader,  
Desireless One, with love \[for them,\]  
then thrilled[^4] uncountable beings. (3) \[1897\]

Breaking off a stem of flowers,  
that brahmin master of mantras,  
assembling all \[of his\] students ,  
threw \[them right up\] into the sky. (4) \[1898\]

There was a floral canopy  
over the whole city[^5] then;  
through the power of the Buddha,  
they were there an entire week.[^6] (5) \[1899\]

By means of just those wholesome roots,  
experiencing happiness,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
\[I’ve\] crossed over worldly ties. (6) \[1900\]

In the eleventh aeon \[hence\]  
there were thirty-five \[different\] kings[^7]  
known Ambaraṃsasama,[^8]  
wheel-turning kings with great power. (7) \[1901\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8)

Thus indeed Venerable Pupphachadanīya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pupphachadanīya Thera is finished.
