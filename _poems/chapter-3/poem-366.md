*\[363. {366.}*[^1] *Kadambapupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
Seated in the palace doorway  
I saw the Leader of the World,  
the Golden-Colored Sambuddha,  
like a costly thing made of gold,  
Bearing the Marks of Great Man,  
\[who was\] traveling in the sky.  
Taking a *kadamba* flower,  
I offered[^3] \[it\] to Vipassi. (1-2) \[3199-3200\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[3201\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3202\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Kadambapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kadambapupphiya Thera is finished.
