### \[397. {400.}[^1] Ajita[^2]\]

The Victor,[^3] Padumuttara,  
was the Master of Everything.[^4]  
Plunged into the Himalayas,  
the Leader of the World sat down. (1) \[3856\]

I did not see the Sambuddha,  
I also did not hear \[his\] sound.  
Searching for food for me to eat,  
I was wandering in the woods. (2) \[3857\]

There I did see the Sambuddha,  
Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks.[^5]  
Seeing \[the Buddha\] made me think,[^6]  
“what sort of[^7] being[^8] might this be?” (3) \[3858\]

Examining \[his body’s\] marks,  
I recalled my \[studies of\] lore,  
the good words which I \[once\] had heard,  
from[^9] elderly[^10] men of wisdom:[^11] (4) \[3859\]

“According to that word of theirs,  
this \[person\] will be a Buddha;  
well then I ought to honor \[him\];  
it will purify my station.”[^12] (5) \[3860\]

Quickly coming to \[my\] ashram,  
I grabbed[^13] \[some\] buffalo ghee,[^14] and  
taking a pot \[to carry it,\]  
I approached \[him\], the Bull of Men.[^15] (6) \[3861\]

Taking a three-legged \[stool\],[^16] I  
stood it \[up\] in an open space.  
Lighting a lamp \[placed on that stool,\]  
I worshipped \[the Buddha\] eight times. (7) \[3862\]

Seven nights and days the Buddha,  
sat \[there\], the Ultimate Person.  
Then at the end of the \[last\] night,[^17]  
\[Buddha\] stood up, the World-Leader. \[3863\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
for seven nights and days I lit  
\[that\] lamp for the \[seated\] Buddha,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by my own hands. \[3864\]

All the good scents of the forests[^18]  
on Gandhamādana Mountain,  
by means of Buddha’s majesty[^19]  
then went up to \[him\], the Victor. \[3865\]

\[All of\] the trees \[were then\] in bloom.  
By means of Buddha’s majesty  
all of the floral scents produced,[^20]  
assembled into one right then. \[3866\]

Throughout the Himalayas, both  
the snake-gods and the *garuḷas*,  
desiring to hear the Teaching,  
came into the Buddha’s presence. \[3867\]

The monk whose name was Devala  
was the Buddha’s chief attendant.  
With one hundred thousand masters,  
he \[also\] approached the Buddha.[^21] \[3868\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly,  
\[then\] spoke these verses \[about me\]: \[3869\]

“He who has lit a lamp for me,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by his own hands,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: \[3870\]

For sixty thousand aeons he  
will delight in the world of gods.  
A thousand times he’ll be a king,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. \[3871\]

Thirty-six times lord of the gods,  
he will exercise divine rule.  
Seven hundred \[times\][^22] on the earth,  
he’ll rule an extensive kingdom,[^23]  
\[and he will have\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. \[3872\][^24]

Because of this lamp-offering,  
he will develop “divine eye.”  
This one is always going to see  
eight *kosa*\s[^25] in all directions.[^26] \[3873\]

Fallen from the world of the gods,  
when this person has been reborn,  
whether by day or else by night,  
a lamp will be carried \[for him\]. \[3874\]

When this person’s[^27] being reborn,  
a possessor of good karma,  
he will illuminate \[the world\]  
throughout the city \[where\] he is. \[3875\]

In whichever womb he’s reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
because of his lamp-offering,  
due to the fruit of \[those\] eight lamps,  
people will not surpass this one:  
that is the fruit of giving lamps. \[3876\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. \[3877\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled. \[3878\]

Having pleased \[him\], the Sambuddha,  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,  
he’ll be the Teacher’s follower,  
\[and his\] name \[will be\] Ajita.” \[3879\]

For sixty thousand aeons I  
delighted in the world of gods.  
In that place too my hundred lamps  
are burning \[brightly\] all the time.[^28] \[3880\]

In the gods’ world or that of men,  
my \[own\] effulgence[^29] is diffused.  
Remembering the Best Buddha,  
I generate enormous mirth. \[3881\]

Falling from Tusitā heaven,  
I came out of a mother’s womb.  
While that person[^30] was being born,  
there was \[always\] a lot of light. \[3882\]

Having departed from the house,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
Having gone up to Bāvarī,  
I agreed to be his student.[^31] \[3883\]

Living in the Himalayas,  
I heard \[about\][^32] the World-Leader.  
Searching for ultimate meaning,  
I approached \[the Buddha\], the Guide.[^33] \[3884\]

The Tame One, Buddha, He who Tames,  
the Flood-Crosser, Beyond Rebirth,[^34]  
the Buddha spoke of nirvana,  
liberation from all dis-ease. \[3885\]

His coming to me succeeded;  
I entertained \[him\], the Great Sage.  
Attaining the three knowledges,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[3886\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave \[him\] that lamp back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving lamps. \[3887\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
All defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (26) \[3888\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (27) \[3889\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (28) \[3890\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ajita Thera spoke these verses.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Unconquered”

[^3]: lit., “the Victor named Padumuttara”

[^4]: lit., “master of all things (*dhamma*)” (or “Master of All Teachings”)

[^5]: on the bodies of those destined to become a wheel-turning monarch or a Buddha

[^6]: *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ittam āpajjiŋxi*, lit., “I produced the thought”

[^7]: *ko nāma*

[^8]: or “person,” “living being,” “creature:” *satto*

[^9]: lit., “of” (gen. case)

[^10]: reading *vuddhānaṃ* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *Buddhānaŋ*

[^11]: *paṇḍitānaŋ*

[^12]: *gatiŋ me sodhayissati*, i.e., “it will clean up my karma;” “it will get me a better rebirth”

[^13]: *gahim*

[^14]: reading *madhutelaṃ* (Sinhala gloss: *mītel*) with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *dumatelaŋ* (“tree oil”). The term could also be read as a compound, “honey and oil;” the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reading could be sustained by taking *mītel* as the tree oil of that name, which is produced from the seeds of the *mī* tree, Bassia longifolia (*Sapot.*). Indeed, *madhu* (“honey”) can also refer to this oil. However, buffalo ghee would be a more likely oil for lamp-lighting than *mī* oil (which is used primarily in the making of medicines), so I have followed the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reading here, leaving open these other possibilities.

[^15]: reading *narāsabhaṃ* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> (and <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> alt.) *vināyakaŋ* (“Guide”)

[^16]: *tindaṇḍake*, lit., “three-sticked”. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> glosses the term as *piriväjipuṭuwa*, “the stool (or chair) \[used by\] ascetics”

[^17]: *ratyā vivasāne*, read *ratyā vivasane*, “at the end of the night,” a stock phrase.

[^18]: *sabbe vanā gandhamayā*, lit., “all the forests made of good scents.” I am assuming that despite the Buddha’s magical power, the trees themselves did not come to him, though that is the Pāli (and <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> glosses in Sinhala accordingly). Rather, I take the meaning to be that the scents of those forests came to him.

[^19]: *anubhāvena*, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> notes that all the texts give *ānubhāvena*

[^20]: *pupphagandhāse*, following <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss here

[^21]: lit., “went up to the Buddha’s presence”

[^22]: following <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss: *satsiya varak*

[^23]: *vipulaṃ rajjaṃ karissati*, following <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss

[^24]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> agree in presenting this as a six-footed verse.

[^25]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> understands this as a measure of distance, *krōśa* = 500 bow-lengths, 80 bull-lengths, 8000 *riyan* (*Śri Sumaṅgala Śabdakoṣaya*, s.v.)

[^26]: *samantato*, “on all sides” “everywhere”

[^27]: *sattassa*, also “being” “creature” (gen. abs. construction)

[^28]: lit., “every day”

[^29]: *prabhā*

[^30]: *sattassa* (gen. abs. construction)

[^31]: *sissattaṃ ajjupāgamiṃ*

[^32]: following the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss “(*geṇa*)”

[^33]: *vināyakaṃ*

[^34]: *nirūpadhi*, i.e., “devoid of the ground for rebirth,” “free of the *upadhis*”

[^35]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>: Piḷindava<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha

[^36]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>: Salala°

[^37]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>: Piḷindava<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha

[^38]: *vaggadasakaŋ*

[^39]: *Sataka* is a common structure in Sanskrit and Pāli poetry, usually referring to one hundred verses, rather than (as here) one hundred stories.
