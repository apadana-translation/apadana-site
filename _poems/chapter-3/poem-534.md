### \[531. {534.}[^1] Dabbamalla[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the Sage, Knower of Every World,  
the One who had \[Five\] Eyes, arose  
a hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[5769\]

The Admonisher,[^3] Instructor,[^4]  
Crosser-Over[^5] of all that breathe,  
Skilled at Preaching,[^6] \[he\], the Buddha,  
caused many folks to cross \[the flood\]. (2) \[5770\]

Merciful,[^7] Compassionate One,[^8]  
Well-Wisher[^9] of all that breathe, he  
established in the five precepts  
all the rivals who had arrived. (3) \[5771\]

In this way he was Unconfused[^10]  
and Very Well-Known[^11] by rivals,  
Ornamented[^12] by arahants  
who were masters \[and\] neutral ones. (4) \[5772\]

The \[body of the\] Sage So Great  
rose up fifty-eight cubits[^13] \[tall\];  
he was Valuable Like Gold,[^14]  
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. (5) \[5773\]

\[People’s\] lifespan at that time was  
\[fully\] one hundred thousand years.  
Remaining \[in the world\] so long,  
he ferried many folks across. (6) \[5774\]

I was then a millionaire’s son  
in Haṃsavatī, of great fame.  
Approaching the Lamp of the World,[^15]  
I heard the preaching of *Dhamma*. (7) \[5775\]

I was happy after hearing  
the words of \[the Buddha\] praising  
his follower, the \[monk who was\]  
appointing lodgings[^16] for the monks. (8) \[5776\]

\[My\] head bowed at the feet of the  
Great Sage, I aspired to attain  
that place, \[foremost\] among those who  
do the Assembly's management. (9) \[5777\]

At that time the Great Hero spoke;[^17]  
he praised my karma \[in this way\]:  
“Who fed the Leader of the World,  
with the Assembly, for a week, (10) \[5778\]

whose eyes are \[just like\] lotus leaves,  
lion-shouldered, with golden skin;  
fallen down in front of my feet,  
he has wished for that \[foremost\] place. (11) \[5779\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (12) \[5780\]

That Buddha’s follower \[will be\]  
well-known by the name of Dabba.  
This one is going to be the top  
assigner of the lodgings then.” (13) \[5781\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (14) \[5782\]

Three hundred times \[the lord of gods,\]  
I exercised divine rule \[there\],  
and \[then\] five hundred times I was  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (15) \[5783\]

\[There was also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting.  
Through the power of that karma,  
I was happy in every place. (16) \[5784\]

The Leader known as Vipassi,  
with Insight into Everything,[^18]  
Charming-Eyed One, arose in the  
world, ninety-one aeons ago. (17) \[5785\]

Evil-minded, I reproached a  
follower of that Neutral One  
who had destroyed all defilements,  
despite having known, “he is pure.” (18) \[5786\]

Having provided meal-tickets,[^19]  
I offered rice \[well-cooked\] in milk  
to great sages, the followers  
of that very Hero of Men.[^20] (19) \[5787\]

During this auspicious aeon  
Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,  
named Kassapa through \[his\] lineage,[^21]  
Best Debater,[^22] \[Buddha,\] arose. (20) \[5788\]

Lighting up the dispensation,  
overcoming evil rivals,  
instructing the instruct-able, he  
reached nirvana,[^23] with followers.[^24] (21) \[5789\]

Hair-loosened, teary-faced, the gods,  
were moved \[and\] they wept when the Lord  
and students reached nirvana, \[his\]  
dispensation reaching[^25] \[its\] goal: (22) \[5790\]

“Alas! We have little merit.  
The *Dhamma*-Eye passes away.[^26]  
We’ll not see the compliant ones,  
we will not hear the great Teaching.” (23) \[5791\]

\[Just\] then the whole of this \[great\] earth,  
which is unshaking, shook with shakes,  
and the ocean, as though in grief,[^27]  
was crying a piteous song. (24) \[5792\]

\[And\] drums in \[all\] four directions,  
were played by non-human beings;  
lightening burst out[^28] from everywhere,  
frightening[^29] \[beings who were there\]. (25) \[5793\]

Meteors[^30] fell down from the sky,  
and he whose flag is smoke[^31] was[^32] seen.  
The wild beasts roared piteously,  
and all the creatures born on earth. (26) \[5794\]

Seeing fierce omens[^33] marking[^34] the  
setting of the dispensation,[^35]  
moved, we monks who \[still remained\] there,  
then thought \[about it in this way\]: (27) \[5795\]

“\[Now\], without our[^36] dispensation,  
enough with life \[itself for us\].  
Entering the forest we’ll strive  
in the Victor’s dispensation.” (28) \[5796\]

We saw a tall, superb mountain  
\[there\] in the forest at that time.  
Ascending by a flight of stairs,[^37]  
we fell down[^38] on the flight of stairs. (29) \[5797\]

Then an elder[^39] admonished us:  
“A Buddha’s rising’s hard to get;  
well-got for you is getting faith,  
the dispensation’s small remnant.  
Fallen down they’re missing \[their\] chance,  
in the endless suffering-sea.  
Therefore strong effort should be made  
while the Sage’s thought remains.” (30-31) \[5798-5799\]

That elder was an arahant,  
a non-returner followed him.[^40]  
Fixed in good morality, the  
rest \[of us\] went to the gods’ world. (32) \[5800\]

In the pure abode that one \[monk\][^41]  
reached nirvana, crossed existence;[^42]  
\[but\] I and Pukkusāti \[too\],  
Sabhiya, likewise Bāhiya,  
so too Kumāra-Kassapa,  
reborn here and there we are \[now\][^43]  
freed from the bonds of existence,  
pitied by Gotama \[Buddha\]. (33-34) \[5801-5802\]

Born a Kusināran Malla,  
even in the womb I’m conscious.  
Dead mother[^44] raised up on a pyre;  
I was \[one who\] fell out[^45] from that. (35) \[5803\]

I landed[^46] on a pile of wood;[^47]  
therefore I was known as “Dabba.”[^48]  
Through the strength of holy living,[^49]  
I was freed, \[just\] seven years old. (36) \[5804\]

Due to the fruit of the milk-rice,[^50]  
I’m endowed with the five fine traits;[^51]  
due to reproaching the pure monk,[^52]  
I was urged by many bad folks.[^53] (37) \[5805\]

Now I am one who’s passed beyond  
both merit and evil \[karma\].  
Attaining supreme peacefulness,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled. (38) \[5806\]

Making the compliant ones laugh,  
I appointed lodgings \[for them\].  
The Victor, pleased by[^54] that virtue,  
\[then\] placed me in that foremost place. (39) \[5807\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (40) \[5808\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (41) \[5809\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (42) \[5810\]

Thus indeed Venerable Dabbamallaputta Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Dabbamallaputta Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: BJTS reads *Dabba*. In the colophon both PTS and BJTS give “Dabbamallaputta,” “Dabba the son of the Mallians”. A historical monk, famous as the foremost among those who assigned lodgings (*senāsanapaññāpakānaṃ*, lit., “beds and chairs”), see DPPN I:1059-1060. “He was called Dabba because he was said to be born of his mother while she was being burnt in the funeral pyre; when the flames were extinguished, the child was found lying on one of the posts of the pyre (*dabbatthambhe*)” I translate this term (*dabbapuñjamhi*) more literally as “pile of wood.” The name Dabba means “wood”.

[^3]: *ovādako*

[^4]: *viññāpako*

[^5]: *tārako*

[^6]: *desanākusalo*

[^7]: *anukampako*

[^8]: *kāruṇiko*

[^9]: *hitesi*

[^10]: *nirākulaŋ*

[^11]: *suñññataŋ*, or “empty \[of ill-will\],” which is BJTS Sinhala gloss reading; I construe the epithet as *su* + *ñata*

[^12]: *vicittaŋ*

[^13]: *ratanāna-aṭṭha-paññāsaŋ uggato*. A *ratana* (Sinh. *riyan*) is figured as twelve-fingers (*aṅgula*), according to Sinh-Eng Dictionary about eighteen inches. The claim here then is that Padumuttara Buddha was about 1044 inches (or 87 feet) tall.

[^14]: *kañcanagghiyasaṅkāso*, lit., “like a gold valuable thing” or “like a gold festoon work”

[^15]: *lokapajjotaŋ*

[^16]: lit., “beds \[and\] chairs” or “beds and food”

[^17]: reading *tadā ‘bhāsi mahāvīro* with BJTS for PTS *tadahaŋ sa mahāvīro*

[^18]: *sabbadhammavipassako*

[^19]: or “counting sticks:” *salākaŋ*

[^20]: *tasseva naravīrassa*

[^21]: reading *gottena* with BJTS for PTS *nāmena* (“named” “known as”)

[^22]: *vadataŋvaro*

[^23]: *nibbuto*

[^24]: *sasāvako*, or perhaps, taking this as an epithet, “He with Followers passed away.” But the following verse reinforces the reading that his nirvana was itself a corporate event, occurring simultaneously with the nirvana-realizations of his followers (*sāvaka*, “listeners”) or students (*sissa*).

[^25]: *entamhi*, fr. *eti*, loc. abs. construction

[^26]: *nibbāyissati dhammakkho* (BJTS reads *°akho*), lit., “the eye of *Dhamma* will reach nirvana”

[^27]: *sāgaro ca sasoko va*

[^28]: reading *phaliṃsu* with BJTS for PTS *patiŋsu*, fell down, avoiding the redundancy with the next verse in keeping with the eloquence of this passage.

[^29]: lit., “carrying fear to”

[^30]: *ukkā*, “fiery things”. Elsewhere the term more directly refers to fire or a firebrand itself, but this meaning of the term is appropriate here both because these “fires” fall from the sky and because the following miracle, distinguished with an “and” (*ca*), specifies fire as such. Cty (p. 506) gives *aggikhandhā*, “great masses of fire”

[^31]: *dhūmaketu*, that is, “fire”

[^32]: lit., “is”

[^33]: *uppāde dāruṇe*

[^34]: *sūvake*, lit., “making manifest” “indicating,” see Buddhadatta *Pāli-Sinhala Akārādiya*, s.v.

[^35]: “setting” as in the setting of the sun, reading *sāsanatthagama-suvake* (read *sūvake*) with BJTS for PTS *sāsanatthañ ca sūcakaŋ*

[^36]: reading *sāsanena vināmhākaṃ* with BJTS for PTS *sāsanena vinā sammā*

[^37]: reading *nisseṇiyā* with BJTS for PTS *nisseniyā*

[^38]: reading *pātayimhase* with BJTS for PTS *pātayiṃhase*

[^39]: *thero*

[^40]: i.e., to nirvana, as opposed (and superior) to heaven or "the gods' world”

[^41]: i.e., the “non-returner” accompanying the arahant (who went nowhere at all, i.e., who had no more rebirth in any abode)

[^42]: *nibbuto tiṇṇasaŋsāro*

[^43]: lit., “went up to,” following BJTS Sinh. gloss and reading with BJTS *tattha tatthupagā mayaṃ* for PTS *tattha tatth’ upagāmiyaŋ* (“he went up to here and there”)

[^44]: reading *matā mātā* with BJTS (and PTS alt. cited as *mātā mātā*?) for PTS *mātā pitā* (“mother and father”)

[^45]: reading *nippatito* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *nibbattito*, “produced” “brought forth”

[^46]: lit., “fallen”

[^47]: *dabba-puñjamhi*

[^48]: “Wood”

[^49]: or “of celibacy”, reading *brahmacāribalena* with BJTS (and cf. PTS alt. *brahmacara*) for PTS *brahmaceraphalena* (“through the fruit of Brahma-\[\]?”)

[^50]: see above, v. 19 \[5797\]; this was a pious act done by the protagonist during the time of Vipassi Buddha

[^51]: *pañcaṅgehi upāgato*. RD, the “five gentlemanly qualities” of a king or brahmin are *sujāta* (good birth), *ajjhāyaka* (education, learning in the Vedas), *abhirūpa* (handsomeness), *sīlavā* (moral conduct) and *paṇḍita* (wisdom)

[^52]: lit., “the one whose defilements are destroyed,” i.e., “the arahant”. BJTS reads *khīṇāsavopavādena* for PTS’ misleading ungrammatical *khīṇāsavo pavādena* (“because of the arahant reproaching” rather than “because of reproaching the arahant”)

[^53]: *pāpehi bahu codito*

[^54]: lit., “in”
