*\[230. Ekavandiya*[^1]*\]*  
Cheerful, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I worshipped the Best of Buddhas,  
Vessabhu, Victorious One,  
the Bull, the Excellent, Hero. (1) \[2420\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of worshipping. (2) \[2421\]

In the twenty-fourth aeon \[hence\]  
\[lived one\] named Vigatānanda,[^2]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2422\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2423\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekavandiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ekavandiya Thera is finished.
