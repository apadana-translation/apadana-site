*\[232. Bhājanadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
In the city, Bandumatī,  
I was a potter at that time.  
For a long time I protected[^2]  
vessels for the monks’ Assembly.[^3] (1) \[2428\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I protected \[the monks’\] vessels,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of \[protecting\] vessels. (2) \[2429\]  
In the fifty-third aeon hence  
was \[one\] named Anantajāli,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2430\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2431\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Bhājanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Bhājanadāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Vessel Donor”  
[^2]: *anupālesiŋ.* One would prefer the meaning “I made” or “I
    provided,” but this is the Pāli.  
[^3]: *bhikkhusaṅgha*  
[^4]: “Unlimited Nets” (taking *jālin* from *jāla*; or “Unlimited
    Armor,” taking *jālin* from *jālikā*?)
