*\[{557.}*[^1] *Apara Uttara*[^2]*\]*  
When the World’s Lord reached nirvana,  
Siddhattha, Leader of the World,  
having summoned my relatives,  
I worshipped[^3] \[that Buddha’s\] relics. \[6423\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I worshipped[^4] \[those\] relics \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of relic-worship. \[6424\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. \[6425\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6426\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6427\]

Thus indeed Venerable Apara Uttara Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Apara Uttara Thera, the seventh.

    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

    This same *apadāna* appears above, verbatim, as \#483 {486}, where
    it is ascribed to a monk named Dhātupūjaka (“Relic-Worshipper”)
