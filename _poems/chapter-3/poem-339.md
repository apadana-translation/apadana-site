*\[336. {339.}*[^1] *Dhammasavaniya*[^2]*\]*  
The Victor, Padumuttara,  
was the Master of Everything.[^3]  
\[While\] preaching the Four Noble Truths,  
he ferried many folks across. (1) \[3042\]  
A matted-haired ascetic[^4] then,  
I practiced fierce austerities.[^5]  
Throwing off \[my\] clothes made of bark,  
I traveled in the sky back then. (2) \[3043\]  
Then I was unable to fly[^6]  
over \[him\], the Best of Buddhas.  
Like a bird hitting[^7] a mountain,  
I did not get to journey on.[^8] (3) \[3044\]  
My movement had not formerly  
been obstructed in such a way;[^9]  
as though rising up[^10] from water,  
I easily[^11] flew[^12] through the sky. (4) \[3045\]  
“A lofty human being must[^13]  
be sitting underneath \[me now\].  
It’s good[^14] for me to search for him;  
I might obtain something worthwhile.”[^15](5) \[3046\]  
Then descending from the sky, I  
heard the sound of the Teacher,  
who was preaching impermanence;  
I learned that \[lesson\] at that time. (6) \[3047\]  
Learning to see[^16] impermanence  
I went back to my hermitage.  
Dwelling there the rest of my life,  
I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (7) \[3048\]  
In \[my\] subsequent existence,  
I recalled hearing that Teaching.  
Due to that karma done very well,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (8) \[3049\]  
For thirty thousand aeons I  
delighted in the world of gods.  
And I exercised divine rule,  
one more than fifty \[different\] times. (9) \[3050\]  
And seventy-one \[different\] times  
I was a wheel-turning monarch.  
There was \[also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (10) \[3051\]  
\[Then\] seated in my father’s house,  
a monk with senses \[well-\]controlled,  
illustrating \[the truth\] in verse,[^17]  
spoke of things as impermanent.[^18] (11) \[3052\]  
Remembering that perception,  
transmigrating from birth to birth,  
I \[still\] did not perceive the end,  
nirvana, everlasting state. (12) \[3053\]  
“In flux indeed is all that is;  
things come to be \[and then\] decay.  
They arise \[and then\] they dissolve;  
their cessation[^19] is happiness.” (13) \[3054\][^20]  
After hearing \[him say\] that verse,[^21]  
I recalled my past perception.  
Seated in a single sitting,  
I achieved the arahant-state. (14) \[3055\]  
Being \[only\] seven years old,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.  
Recognizing \[my\] virtue the  
Buddha, Eyeful One ordained me. (15) \[3056\]  
Even though I was a \[mere\] boy,  
I finished what needs to be done.  
Today what do I need to do  
in the Śākyan’s dispensation?[^22] (16) \[3057\]  
In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I did that \[good\] karma then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit in hearing the Teaching.[^23] (17) \[3058\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (18) \[3059\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Dhammasavaniya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Dhammasavaniya Thera is finished.
