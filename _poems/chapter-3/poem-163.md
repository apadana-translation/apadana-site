*\[163. Khajjakadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
In the past I gave some fruit \[then\]  
to \[him\], Tissa, the Blessed One.  
I gave coconut and also  
sweet-meats, such as were fit \[for him\]. (1) \[2062\]

And giving that to the Buddha,  
to Tissa, the Very Great Sage,  
pleasure-seeking[^2] I delighted,  
being reborn just as I wished. (2) \[2063\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I gifted \[him\] that gift back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[2064\]

In the thirteenth aeon ago  
there was a king, Indasama,[^3]  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2065\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2066\]

Thus indeed Venerable Khajjakadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Khajjakadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Sweet-Meat Giver”. *Khajjaka* (Sinhala *khādya, rasa kävili*) refers to the range of sweets (in contemporary Sri Lanka, typically made with coconut and palm sugar or honey) which are prepared for festivals, parties and other special occasions, and which are allowed to monks with their afternoon tea (they do not take an actual evening meal, so these sweets are often the sustenance for scrupulous monks in the evening).

[^2]: lit., “pleasure-doing,” one who acts for the sake of pleasure, *kāmakāri.*

[^3]: “Same as Indra \[king of the gods\]”.
