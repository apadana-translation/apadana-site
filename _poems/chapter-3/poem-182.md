*\[182. Bandhujīvaka*[^1]*\]*  
The Sambuddha named Siddhattha,  
Self-Become, praised by good people,[^2]  
having entered concentration,[^3]  
sat down upon a mountain \[then\]. (1) \[2157\]  
Searching in a natural lake  
for a superb lotus flower,  
I saw *bandhujīvaka* blooms  
in the nearby vicinity. (2) \[2158\]  
Picking \[them\] up with both \[my\] hands,  
I \[then\] approached the Sage So Great.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I offered \[them\] to Siddhattha. (3) \[2159\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I offered \[those\] flower\[s\] \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of flower-*pūjā.* (4) \[2160\]  
In the fourteenth aeon ago,  
there was one ruler of people  
whose name was Samuddakappa,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great power. (5) \[2161\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2162\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Bandhujīvaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Bandhujīvaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: the name of a flower, Sinhala *banduvada*, Latin *pentapetes
    phoenicea* aka midday flower, noon flower, scarlet pentapetes,
    scarlet mallow, copper cups, scarlet phoenecian, any of which could
    appropriately translate the protagonist's name  
[^2]: I follow BJTS Sinhala gloss in taking *sabhi* as *satpuruṣayen*  
[^3]: *samādhiṃ so samāpanno*  
[^4]: “Ocean-Aeon”.
