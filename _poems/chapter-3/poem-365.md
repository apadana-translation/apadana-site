### \[362. {365.}[^1] Aṅkolapupphiya[^2]\]

The Sambuddha named Paduma  
dwelt on Cittakūṭa[^3] back then.  
Having seen him I \[then\] approached  
the Buddha, the Self-Become One. (1) \[3195\]

Seeing an *aṅkola* flower,  
I collected[^4] \[it\] at that time.  
Approaching the Sambuddha, I  
worshipped[^5] the Victor, Paduma. (2) \[3196\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[3197)  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3198\]

Thus indeed Venerable Aṅkolapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Aṅkolapupphiya Thera is finished.
