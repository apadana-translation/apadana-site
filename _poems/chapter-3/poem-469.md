### \[466. {469.}[^1] Sayampaṭibhāṇiya[^2]\]

“Who is not pleased after seeing  
the God of Gods, the Bull of Men,  
shining like a dinner-plate tree,  
\[when he’s\] going along the road? (1) \[4908\]

Who is not pleased after seeing  
him shining the light of knowledge,  
driving away \[all\] the darkness,  
ferrying many folks across? (2) \[4909\]

Who is not pleased after seeing  
the Leader of the World going  
with one hundred thousand masters,  
\[and\] lifting up many beings? (3) \[4910\]

Who is not pleased after seeing  
\[him\] beat the drum of the Teaching,  
sounding[^3] the roar of a lion,  
crushing groups of ford-worshippers?[^4] (4) \[4911\]

Who is not pleased after seeing  
\[all the gods\] including Brahmā  
come all the way from Brahmā’s world,  
asking \[Buddha\] subtle questions? (5) \[4912\]

Who is not pleased after seeing  
\[the world\] with \[its\] gods imploring,  
\[both\] hands pressed together for him,  
enjoying merit due to that? (6) \[4913\]

Who is not pleased after seeing  
all the people come together,  
attending on[^5] the Eyeful One?  
Invited,[^6] he does not waver. (7) \[4914\]

Who is not pleased after seeing  
numerous drums bellowing, \[and\]  
rutting elephants trumpeting,  
when he’s entering the city? (8) \[4915\]

Who is not pleased after seeing  
the All-Bright One[^7] always shining,  
\[and\] raised spots[^8] becoming level,  
when he is going on the road?[^9] (9) \[4916\]

Who is not pleased after seeing  
\[him\] instructing every being,  
being heard throughout the cosmos,[^10]  
when the Blessed One[^11] is speaking?” (10) \[4917\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I praised the Buddha \[like that\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of praising \[him\]. (11) \[4918\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (12) \[4919\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (13) \[4920\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[4921\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sayampaṭibhāṇiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sayampaṭibhāṇiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Understanding \[or Illumination, Ready Wit, Confident Speech, etc.\] by Himself-er.” Compare \#64, the *apadāna* of Parappasādaka (“Other-Pleaser”), for a different *apadāna* employing a parallel grammatical construction

[^3]: reading *vinadantaṃ* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *vinādantaŋ*

[^4]: or “the groups of heretics,” *titthiye gaṇe*

[^5]: *sampavārenti*, lit., “doing service with \[each other\]” or “doing service together”

[^6]: BJTS reads this to mean that one who is invited to join in would not hesitate to do so.

[^7]: *sabbabhā*, note the singular verb; I follow BJTS Sinh. gloss in treating this as an epithet referring to the BUddha.

[^8]: *abbhuṇṇatā*, BJTS reads *abbhunnatā*, both spellings are witnessed elsewhere in the Pāli.

[^9]: *vīthiyā*; BJTS (and PTS alt.) read *rathiyā*, both terms means “road” (in the locative, or else the instrumental “along the road”).

[^10]: lit., “within the universe,” *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>akkavāḷamhi*

[^11]: lit., “the Buddha”
