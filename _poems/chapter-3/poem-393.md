*\[390. {393.}*[^1] *Sabbakittika*[^2]*\]*  
I saw the Leader of the World, (3d) \[3679\][^3]  
shining like a dinner-plate tree,[^4]  
blazing forth like a tree of lamps,  
radiant like the morning star,[^5]  
like lightening in a mass of clouds, (1) \[3677\]

not frightened, never terrified,  
like a lion, king of the beasts,  
illuming the knowledge-light,[^6]  
crushing the groups of heretics,[^7] (2) \[3678\]

elevating this \[entire\] world,  
eliminating every doubt,[^8]  
roaring[^9] like the king of the beasts. (3a-c) \[3679a-c\][^10]  
With matted hair, wearing a hide,  
lofty, strong, and powerful, I  
took[^11] \[my\] robe made out of bark \[and\]  
spread it[^12] at the soles of \[his\][^13] feet. (4) \[3680\]

Taking a \[fragrant\] black creeper,[^14]  
I anointed[^15] the Thus-Gone-One.  
After anointing the Buddha,[^16]  
I praised[^17] the Leader of the World: (5) \[3681\]

“O Great Sage, Crosser of the Flood,[^18]  
you are lifting up the \[whole\] world.  
You are shining with knowledge-light,  
\[your\] supreme lightening\[-like\] knowledge. (6) \[3682\]

You turn the wheel of the Teaching,  
you crush the rival heretics,[^19]  
the Bull, the Winner at Meetings,[^20]  
you are shaking the \[entire\] world. (7) \[3683\]

Like the waves of the great ocean,  
breaking on the edge of the shore,  
every misguided view breaks up  
\[when it crashes\][^21] on your knowledge. (8) \[3684\]

When a net[^22] which has very fine  
mesh has been stretched out[^23] in a lake,  
creatures[^24] entangled in the net[^25]  
instantly \[find themselves\] oppressed. (9) \[3685\]

So the heretics in the world,  
attached to the various sects,[^26]  
do thrash about, O Happy One,[^27]  
\[entangled\] in your great knowledge.[^28] (10) \[3686\]

Support[^29] for those caught in the flood,  
you’re the Lord[^30] for those lacking kin,  
Refuge[^31] for those distressed by fear,  
Relief[^32] for those seeking freedom, (11) \[3687\]

the One Hero,[^33] the Unmatched One,[^34]  
the Heap of Compassion and Love,[^35]  
Moral One,[^36] Unequaled,[^37] Peaceful,[^38]  
Master,[^39] Neutral,[^40] the Winning Road,[^41] (12) \[3688\]

Wise One,[^42] Whose Delusion’s Destroyed,[^43]  
Lust-less One,[^44] Who Speaks the Unsaid,[^45]  
Accomplished One,[^46] you’ve Thrown Off Hate,[^47]  
Stainless One,[^48] Restrained,[^49] Pure One,[^50] (13) \[3689\]

Attachment-Free,[^51] Conceit Slain,[^52]  
Arahant,[^53] Three-Worlds-Surpasser,[^54]  
Limit-Free,[^55] Teaching-Respecter,[^56]  
Goal-Reacher,[^57] Whose Rule is Friendship,[^58] (14) \[3690\]

you Ferry Across[^59] like a ship,  
Bring Relief[^60] []{#BookmarkCopy1 .anchor}like buried treasure,[^61]  
are Without Fear[^62] as is a lion,  
Haughty[^63] like an elephant-king.” (15) \[3691\]

Having praised with \[those\] ten verses  
Padumuttara of Great Fame,  
having worshipped the Teacher’s feet,  
I thereafter stood silently. (16) \[3692\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the Teacher, standing in the monks’  
Assembly, spoke these verses \[then\]: (17) \[3693\]

“He who praised my morality,  
\[my\] knowledge, also \[my\] Teaching,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (18) \[3694\]

For sixty thousand aeons he’ll  
delight in the world of the gods.  
Overcoming the other gods,  
he will exercise rulership. (19) \[3695\]

He thereafter having gone forth,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
will go forth in the Blessed One  
Gotama’s dispensation. (20) \[3696\]

Going forth, having avoided  
bad actions[^64] \[done\] with his body,  
destroying all \[his\] defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana,[^65] undefiled.” (21) \[3697\]

“Just like a cloud, which thundering,  
satiates this world \[wanting rain\],  
so indeed did you, Great Hero,  
satiate me \[with\] your thunder.” (22) \[3698\]

Praising morality, wisdom,  
the Teaching and the World’s Leader,  
I attained the ultimate peace,  
nirvana, the unshaking state. (23) \[3699\]

So now indeed the Blessed One,  
the Eyeful One, should long remain;  
\[people\][^66] should learn what \[now\] is known,[^67]  
and \[they\] should reach the deathless state.[^68] (24) \[3700\]

This is my last going around;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
I \[now\] am living, undefiled.[]{#BookmarkCopy12 .anchor} (25) \[3701\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I praised the Buddha \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of praising \[Buddhas\]. (26) \[3702\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
All defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (27) \[3703\]

My being in Buddha’s presence[^69]  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (28) \[3704\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (29) \[3705\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sabbakittika Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sabbakittika Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Every-Praiser”  
[^3]: I have translated the final foot of (3) \[3679\] as the first line
    of this poem: “I saw the Leader of the World”. Placing the verb at
    the end of the string of similes works better in Pāli than it does
    in English, when presenting a string of descriptors as long as this
    one.

    archaic?), dinner-plate tree; Bodhi tree of Siddhattha Buddha.  
[^5]: *osadhī*. RD (s.v.) points out that all we really know about this
    star is that it was particularly bright, leading Childers to
    translate it as “Venus” and others as the morning star.

[^7]: *maddantaŋ titthiye gaṇe*  
[^8]: *chindantaŋ, sabbasaŋsayaŋ,* lit., “cutting off all doubt”  
[^9]: reading *gajjantaŋ* with BJTS for PTS *lasantaŋ,* “playing” or
    “sporting,” also “shining” or “sounding forth”  
[^10]: I have translated (3d) = \[3679d\] as the first line of this
    poem: “I saw the Leader of the World”. Placing the verb at the end
    of the string of epithets works better in Pāli than it does in
    English, when presenting a string of descriptors as long as this
    one.  
[^11]: lit., “having taken,” *gahetvāna*  
[^12]: *apatthariŋ.* BJTS reads *avatthariṃ* (and cf. PTS alt.
    *avattari*), with the same meaning.  
[^13]: i.e., the Buddha’s, following the BJTS SInhala gloss.  
[^14]: reading *kāḷānusāriyaṃ* with BJTS for PTS *kāḷāṇusārikaŋ.* RD
    (s.v.) takes *Kāḷa+anusāriyaṃ* fr. *kala 1,* “black, (pol- ished?)
    Anusāri ("a kind of dark, fragrant sandal wood" Vin. Texts ii.51)
    Vin i.203; S iii.156=v.44= A v.22.” BJTS glosses the term as
    “black-vine (*kaḷuväl*, an odiferous back creeper often used for
    binding given its supple and strong texture) or aloe wood (*agil*).”
    Given the specification of “black” *(kāḷaº*) I take the latter
    reading, though underline that this is not a type of sandalwood in
    either event, and find perplexing that BJTS glosses both black-vine
    and aloe wood as “saffron-colored” (*kasāvat*). The protagonist
    presumably carries with him a paste made by grinding the wood, of
    whichever type (in modern South Asia it usually is indeed a variety
    of sandalwood), into a paste, which is kept on hand for this
    purpose, i.e., for smearing (on the forehead) of a person in order
    to bless him or her.

[^20]: reading *jitasaṅgamo* with BJTS for PTS *jitasaṅgame.* I
    following BJTS Sinhala gloss (*dinana lada saṅgrāma äti,* “he who
    has meetings where he wins”), which seems to take the Pāli as “he
    whose meetings result in defeating \[others\],” but could also mean,
    “He who has meetings with the defeated,” “he by whom meetings are
    defeated,” or, drawing on the “bull” imagery, “he who wins in sexual
    intercourse”  
[^21]: lit., “in just that way,” *tath’ eva*, a filler which translated
    literally does not add to the clarity of the metaphor.  
[^22]: BJTS reads *ºjālena,* (instr.) “by a net,” but I think the PTS
    reading *ºjāle* (loc.) makes better grammatical sense here, the
    first two feet forming an extended locative absolute construction.  
[^23]: *sampatānite*, glossed by BJTS as *atuḷa kalhi*, “when it has
    been spread”  
[^24]: lit., “living things,” *pāṇā*; BJTS glosses ”(fish)” (*matsyayō*)

    breaks meter).  
[^36]: *susīlo,* lit., “one who has good moral discipline”  
[^37]: *asamo*  
[^38]: *santo*  
[^39]: *vasī*  
[^40]: *tādī*  
[^41]: *jitāñjaso*, following BJTS gloss. I read this foot *vasī tadī

[^42]: *dhīro*  
[^43]: *vigatasammoho*

    Conceit” “Intoxicated One”  
[^53]: *tevijjo,* “possessor of the three higher knowledges”
    (recognition of former births, insight into the future destiny of
    all being, recognition of the origin of misery and of the path to
    its removal), that is, an *arahant*. The term is also used in a
    non-Buddhist (Brahmanical) sense, “master of the three Vedas,” but
    here the Buddhist interpretation would seem most appropriate.

    vijāneyyaŋ* (“I should learn”)  
[^68]: reading *phuseyyuṃ amataṃ padaṃ* for PTS *phasseyyam amataŋ
    padaŋ* (“I should touch the deathless path”). *Phassati* is related
    to *phuseti* and in fact can stand for it, but the latter carries
    the applied meaning “reach” or “achieve” (an exalted religious
    state), and the first person makes no sense in context.  
[^69]: here too BJTS agrees with the PTS variant reading of this foot
