*\[394. {397.}*[^1] *Girimānanda*[^2]*\]*  
My wife had passed away, my son  
had gone to the cemetery;  
on a single pyre I had burned  
\[my\] mother, father, and brothers. (1) \[3791\]  
I was consumed due to that grief,  
I had become haggard and pale  
and I was mentally deranged,[^3]  
greatly pained[^4] because of that grief. (2) \[3792\]  
Wounded[^5] by the arrow of grief,  
I went up to the forest’s edge.  
Eating \[only\] wild fruits \[I found\],  
I dwelt at the foot of a tree. (3) \[3793\]  
The Sambuddha named Sumedha,  
the Victor, Ender of Dis-ease,  
with a desire to lift me up,  
did come into my presence \[then\]. (4) \[3794\]  
Having heard the sound of the feet  
of Sumedha, the Sage So Great,  
I having lifted up \[my\] head  
did gaze[^6] upon \[him\], the Great Sage.[^7] (5) \[3795\]  
\[When he\], the Great Hero, approached,  
\[then\] joy did get produced for me.  
Having seen him, the World-Leader,  
my mind \[at last\] was put at ease. (6) \[3796\]  
Having recovered consciousness,[^8]  
I gave \[him\] a handful of leaves.  
The Blessed One \[then\] sat down there,  
out of compassion, Eyeful One. (7) \[3797\]  
Sitting down there, the Blessed One,  
Sumedha, Leader of the World,  
Buddha preached to me the Teaching  
that removes the arrows of grief: (8) \[3798\]  
“Uninvited[^9] \[they’ve\][^10] come[^11] from there;  
not taking leave[^12] \[they’ve\] gone from here.  
As \[they\] have come, so \[they\] have gone;  
what \[good\] is wailing about that?[^13] (9) \[3799\]  
Just as, when rain is raining down,  
people[^14] traveling on the road,[^15]  
taking their goods,[^16] are going to  
\[a place where\] the rain’s not falling, (10) \[3800\]  
and when the rain[^17] has ceased \[to fall,\]  
they carry on[^18] as they had planned;[^19]  
thus your mother \[and\] father \[too\]:[^20]  
what \[good\] is wailing about that? (11) \[3801\]  
\[We’re all\] visiting strangers, guests,  
wavering, driven on, shaken.  
Thus your mother \[and\] father \[too\]:  
what \[good\] is wailing about that? (12) \[3802\]  
Just as a serpent[^21] slithers on,[^22]  
abandoning its worn-out skin,[^23]  
thus your mother \[and\] father \[too\]:  
their bodies[^24] are abandoned here.” (13) \[3803\]  
Understanding the Buddha’s words,  
I removed[^25] the arrow of grief.  
Generating happiness, I  
worshipped the Best of the Buddhas. (14) \[3804\]  
Worshipping the Great Elephant,[^26]  
I offered[^27] Sumedha, Leader  
of the World, a stalk of flowers[^28]  
endowed with a heavenly scent. (15) \[3805\]  
Having worshipped[^29] the Sambuddha,  
pressing my hands upon \[my\] head,  
calling to mind \[his\] chief virtues,  
I praised the Leader of the World: (16) \[3806\]  
“Great Hero, you’re the One Who’s Crossed,[^30]  
Omniscient One, the World-Leader.  
You are lifting up all creatures  
with \[your\] knowledge, O Sage So Great. (17) \[3807\]  
You cut off all perplexity  
and also doubt, O Sage So Great.  
You’re imparting the path[^31] to me  
through your knowledge, O Eyeful One. (18) \[3808\]  
Arahants with the goal attained,[^32]  
six-knowledge-holders, powerful,[^33]  
wise ones who travel in the sky,  
are surrounding you all the time. (19) \[3809\]  
\[Your\] followers are bearing fruit,[^34]  
those attained[^35] and those being trained;[^36]  
your followers are blossoming  
like lotus \[flowers\] at sunrise.[^37] (20) \[3810\]  
As the ocean[^38] is unperturbed,  
unequaled, difficult to cross,  
thus \[too\] are you, O Eyeful One,  
Endowed with Knowledge, Infinite.” (21) \[3811\]  
Having worshipped the World’s Victor,[^39]  
the Eyeful One, he of Great Fame,  
praising each of the directions,  
crouched over[^40] I went off \[from there\]. (22) \[3812\]  
Falling from the world of the gods,[^41]  
transmigrating from birth to birth,  
I came out of \[my\] mother’s womb,  
attentive \[and\] remembering. (23) \[3813\]  
Having departed from the house,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
Zealous,[^42] also intelligent,  
I pastured in meditation.[^43] (24) \[3814\]  
Having put forth \[great\] exertion,[^44]  
having gladdened the Sage So Great,  
I thereafter am wandering,  
like the moon freed from a cloud-bank.[^45] (25) \[3815\]  
I’m \[now\] intent on seclusion,[^46]  
calmed,[^47] devoid of grounds for rebirth;[^48]  
knowing well all the defilements,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled. (26) \[3816\]  
In the thirty thousand aeons  
since I worshipped[^49] the Buddha \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (27) \[3817\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
All defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (28) \[3818\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (29) \[3819\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (30) \[3820\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Girimānanda Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Girimānanda Thera is finished.

[^27]: lit., “did *pūjā* with”  
[^28]: the text is corrupt as regards the object given, apparently an
    attempt at explaining the “Giri” part of the protagonist’s name. I
    follow BJTS (and PTS alt) in reading *girimañjariṃ apūjayiṃ,* “I did
    *pūjā* with a stalk of *giri* \[flowers\],” even though it breaks
    meter (BJTS corrects to *pūjayiṃ girimañjariṃ*). BJTS glosses *giri*
    as *girinil mal,* on which see note to \[2256\]. *Giri* means
    “mountain,” so perhaps the reference is to a stalk of flowers
    (*mañjarī*) growing on a mountain? PTS reads *girapañjaliŋ*
    (“pressing together of the hands in honor of his words”?) offering
    alternatives *giramañchira* (?) and *giripañjariŋ* (fr. *pañjara*, a
    cage?), none of which satisfyingly corresponds to the adjective
    supplied this offering, “endowed with a heavenly scent.”

[^39]: *lokajinaŋ*  
[^40]: taking *paṭikuṭiko* (BJTS reads *patiº*) as fr. *paṭikuṭati* “to
    crouch,” “to bend over”. This may mean that he went off still bowing
    in reverence, or else that he went off on all fours. Here BJTS
    leaves the term unglossed  
[^41]: where he presumably went after the lifetime just recounted  
[^42]: *ātāpī,* lit.,. “burning”  
[^43]: *paṭisallāna-gocaro,* “I sustained myself/fed one retirement into
