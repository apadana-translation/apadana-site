*\[375. {378.}*[^1] *Sumanatālavaṇṭiya*[^2]*\]*

I gave a fan of palmyra,[^3]

covered with jasmine flowers, to

Siddhattha, the Blessed One, \[and\]

bore it \[for\] the Greatly Famed One. (1) \[3262\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I gave that palmyra fan then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of palmyra fans. (2) \[3263\]

My being in Buddha’s presence[^4]

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3264\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (4) \[3265\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[3266\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sumanatālavaṇṭiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sumanatālavaṇṭiya Thera is finished.
