### \[524. {527.}[^1] Girinelapūjaka[^2]\]

I was formerly a hunter,  
wandering in the woods back then.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
\[who was\] Master of Everything. (1) \[5579\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I offered[^3] a *girinil*[^4] bloom  
for the Compassionate One, the  
Delighter,[^5] Friend of All Beings.[^6] (2) \[5580\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I offered[^7] \[him\] that flower then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[5581\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5582\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5583\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5584\]

Thus indeed Venerable Girinelapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Girinelapūjaka Thera is finished.
