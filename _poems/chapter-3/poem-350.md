*\[347. {350.}*[^1] *Ekañjaliya*[^2]*\]*  
The Sambuddha named Revata[^3]  
dwelt on a riverbank back then.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
like the sun with its rays of gold,[^4]  
like beaten[^5] \[gold\][^6] atop a forge,[^7]  
\[burning bright\] like cedar charcoal,[^8]  
shining forth like the morning star.[^9]  
I pressed my hands together once. (1-2) \[3136-3137\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I pressed my hands together \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of saluting. (3) \[3138\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3139\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekañjaliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ekañjaliya Thera is finished.  
The Summary:  
Paduma, Uppalahattha,  
Dhaja, Kiṅkhaṇika, Nala,  
Campaka, Paduma, Muṭṭhi,  
Tinduk and thus Ekañjali.  
There are six plus sixty verses  
which are counted by those who know.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “One Salute.” Cf. \#29, \#275.

[^3]: PTS and BJTS alt. read *Romasa* (cf. \#279). I follow BJTS in reading *Revata* (also a PTS alt.)

[^4]: reading *pītaraṃsiṃ va* with BJTS for PTS *vītaraŋsîva* (“devoid of rays” or “woven rays”). PTS alt. *sataraŋsîva* (“hundred-rayed”) is perhaps better than either of these readings, and consistent with *Apadāna* usage elsewhere (cf. \#33, \#85, \#112, \#153, \#178, \#181, \#185, \#202, \#215, \#309, \#345{348})

[^5]: *pahaṭaŋ,* BJTS reads *pahaṭṭhaŋ* with the same meaning.

[^6]: or bronze, iron, etc.

[^7]: *ukkāmukhaŋ,* the “mouth” (receiving or discharging end) of a furnace or forge, a goldsmith’s smelting pot.

[^8]: *khadiraṅgārasannibha*. *Khadira* is Sinh. *kihiri,* Acacia Sundra, English “red cutch” or “khayer.” The tree produces impressive spikes of yellow flowers but is known primarily for its timber and use in making charcoal.

[^9]: *osadhī*. RD (s.v.) points out that all we really know about this star is that it was particularly bright, leading Childers to translate it as “Venus” and others as the morning star.
