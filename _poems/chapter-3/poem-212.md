*\[212. Pānadhidāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
\[One time\] I gave a \[pair of\] shoe\[s\]  
to a forest-dwelling rishi  
\[who’d\] long practiced austerities,  
grown old, with cultivated thought. (1) \[2324\]

Because of that deed, Biped Lord,[^2]  
Best in the World, O Bull of Men,  
I enjoy every vehicle:  
that is the fruit of past karma. (2) \[2325\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a \[pair of\] shoes. (3) \[2326\]

Seventy-seven aeons hence[^3]  
there were eight of the royal caste[^4]  
known by the name of Suyāna,[^5]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (4) \[2327\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2328\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pānadhidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pānadhidāyaka Thera is finished

[^1]: “Sandal Donor,” taking *panidha* as *pavahanak* following BJTS
    Sinhala gloss. Cf. below, \#476 {479} for a different *apadāna* of a
    monk with the same name

[^2]: This, and the following two epithets are in the vocative case,
    addressing \[presumably Gotama\] Buddha directly. This is one of
    several instances of such use of the vocative which indicate that
    the *apadānas* were believed to have been spoken in the Buddha’s own
    presence (and time), even though some schools of reciters denied
    that implication. See introduction, link xxx

[^3]: lit., “in the seventy-seventh aeon”.

[^4]: lit., “kṣatriyans”

[^5]: “Good Vehicles”
