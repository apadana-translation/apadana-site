*\[5. Puṇṇa-Mantāniputta\]*  
I was a learned mantra-knower  
who had mastered the three Vedas.  
Heading up \[my group of\] students  
I approached \[him\], the Best of Men. (1) \[438\]  
Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the Great Sage then proclaimed to me[^1]  
karma, with the explanation. (2) \[439\]  
After having heard the Teaching,  
\[and\] having worshipped the Teacher  
I held my hands up pressed together  
\[then\] departed facing the south. (3) \[440\]  
Having heard the explanation  
I then preached with more expansion.  
All the students were delighted  
to have listened to my words \[then\]. (4) \[441\]  
Quitting my own philosophy  
\[my\] heart was pleased in the Buddha.  
Then I preached with explanation  
and with the further expansion. (5) \[442\]  
A knower of *Abhidhamma*  
clear about the *Kathāvatthu*,  
providing instruction to all,  
I’m living without defilements. (6) \[443\]  
Five hundred aeons after that  
I was lord of four continents,  
the clever Suppakāsaka[^2]  
possessor of the seven gems. (7) \[444\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[445\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta Thera is finished.  
[^1]: BJTS Sinhala gloss understands “mama” here as the genitive: *my*
    (Sinh: *māgē*) karma. I take it instead as a dative, “to me”  
[^2]: ”Good-Explanation-er,” taking this as a proper name with BJTS.
