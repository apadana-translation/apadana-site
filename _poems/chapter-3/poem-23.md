### \[23. Tīṇisaraṇāgamaniya[^1]\]

In the city, <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andavatī,[^2]  
I was waiting on my parents.  
I constantly provided for  
my blind mother and father \[there\]. (1) \[920\]

Gone off alone and sitting down  
this thought occurred to me back then:  
“while providing for my parents  
I cannot \[yet\] renounce the world.[^3] (2) \[921\]

Being shrouded[^4] in dark blindness  
I’m being scorched by the three fires.[^5]  
Though in such straits, \[and now\] afraid,  
there is no one \[who can\] guide \[me\]. (3) \[922\]

The Buddha’s been born in the world;  
the Victor’s dispensation shines.  
The Self can \[now\] be moved beyond  
by people \[who do\] good[^6] karma. (4) \[923\]

Taking up the Three Refuges  
I’ll \[henceforth\] guard them completely.  
Through that karma which is done well  
I will be released from ill-states.” (5) \[924\]

The Buddha’s foremost follower  
was the monk known as Nisabha.  
After going up to that \[monk\]  
I took the three-fold refuge \[then\].[^7] (6) \[925\]

In those days the normal lifespan  
\[numbered\] one hundred thousand years.[^8]  
For all that time I did protect  
\[my\] taking refuge totally. (7) \[926\]

When \[my\] last \[breath\] was taking place,  
I remembered that refuge \[then\].  
Through that karma which was done well  
I went on to Tāvatiṃsa. (8) \[927\]

Departed, in the world of gods  
well-placed due to \[my\] good karma,  
in every region I was born  
I received the eight good things \[there\].[^9] (9) \[928\]

Worshipped in \[every\] direction,  
I developed piercing wisdom.  
All the gods submitted \[to me\].  
I received food beyond measure. (10) \[929\]

Everywhere, the color of gold,  
I was beloved[^10] \[by everyone\].  
Remaining steadfast for my friends,  
my glory had achieved great heights. (11) \[930\]

Eighty times as the king of gods  
I exercised divine rule \[then\].  
Anointed by celestial nymphs  
I enjoyed \[much\] divine pleasure. (12) \[931\]

\[Full\] five hundred times I ruled \[then\]  
as a monarch who turns the wheel,  
\[and I did have\] much local rule  
innumerable by counting. (13) \[932\]

When \[my\] last rebirth was attained,  
well-placed due to \[my\] good karma,  
I was born in a rich family  
with a big house in Śrāvasti.[^11] (14) \[933\]

Setting out from that \[great\] city  
placed in front by \[other\] children  
I approached a monastery  
\[hoping to find\] sports and laughter.[^12] (15) \[934\]

There I did see a \[Buddhist\] monk,  
set free, and having no desires.  
He explained the Teaching to me  
and gave me the \[three\] refuges. (16) \[935\]

After I heard \[the word\] “refuge,”  
recalling my \[former\] refuge,  
I sat down on a single seat  
\[and then\] attained arahantship. (17) \[936\]

Being \[only\] seven years old  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.  
Knowing virtue, the Eyeful One,  
the Sambuddha ordained \[me then\]. (18) \[937\]

Immeasurable aeons hence  
I went for the \[three-fold\] refuge.  
The fruit \[of\] that karma well done  
is afterward shown to me here. (19) \[938\]

Well-protected was my refuge  
firmly established in my mind.  
After enjoying all of that  
I realized the steadfast state. (20) \[939\]

Let those of you with ears to hear,  
all of you, listen to my words.  
I’m declaring as fact to you  
that I have seen this state myself. (21) \[940\]

“The Buddha’s been born in the world;  
the Victor’s dispensation shines.  
The drum of deathlessness \[now\] sounds,  
removing the arrows of grief. (22) \[941\]

In the unsurpassed merit-field  
if you all \[now\] take ownership  
with all the strength that you possess,[^13]  
\[then\] you all will see nirvana. (23) \[942\]

Taking up the three-fold refuge,  
guarding the five moral precepts,  
pleasing \[your\] heart in the Buddha  
you’ll make an end to suffering. (24) \[943\]

Acting with me as \[your\] model[^14]  
guarding \[all\] the moral precepts  
in a short time, \[then\] all you too  
will attain \[your\] arahantship.” (25) \[944\]

Thrice-knowing,[^15] with superpowers,  
I’m skilled at the reading of minds.[^16]  
A follower of yours, Wise One  
worships the Teacher’s refuges. (26) \[945\]

I went to Buddha for refuge  
uncountable aeons ago.  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of taking refuge. (27) \[946\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (28) \[947\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tīṇisaraṇāgamaniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tīṇisaraṇāgamaniya Thera is finished.
