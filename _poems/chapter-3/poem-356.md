*\[353. {356.}*[^1] *Ambayāgudāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
The Sambuddha, Hundred-Rayed-One,[^3]  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
rising up from meditation,[^4]  
approached me \[begging\] for alms food. (1) \[3161\]  
Seeing the Paccekabuddha,  
with a mind that was very clear,  
I gave gruel \[made with\] mangoes  
to him, the Clear-Minded \[Buddha\]. (2) \[3162\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of gruel \[with\] mangoes. (3) \[3163\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3164\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Ambayāgudāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ambayāgudāyaka Thera is finished.
