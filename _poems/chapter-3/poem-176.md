### \[176. Maggadattika[^1]\]

Anomadassi, Blessed One,  
the Biped-Lord, the Bull of Men,  
bringing happiness to the world,  
walked back and forth across the sky.[^2] (1) \[2129\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my heart,  
worshipping I scattered flower\[s\].  
The flowers stayed on \[his\] raised feet;  
\[also\] on the top of \[his\] head.[^3] (2) \[2130\]

In the twenty-thousandth aeon  
there did live five \[different\] people  
\[all\] named Puppha<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chadaniya,[^4]  
wheel-turning kings with great power. (3) \[2131\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2132\]

Thus indeed Venerable Maggadattika Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Maggadattika Thera is finished.
