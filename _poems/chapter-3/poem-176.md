*\[176. Maggadattika*[^1]*\]*  
Anomadassi, Blessed One,  
the Biped-Lord, the Bull of Men,  
bringing happiness to the world,  
walked back and forth across the sky.[^2] (1) \[2129\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my heart,  
worshipping I scattered flower\[s\].  
The flowers stayed on \[his\] raised feet;  
\[also\] on the top of \[his\] head.[^3] (2) \[2130\]

In the twenty-thousandth aeon  
there did live five \[different\] people  
\[all\] named Pupphacchadaniya,[^4]  
wheel-turning kings with great power. (3) \[2131\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2132\]

Thus indeed Venerable Maggadattika Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Maggadattika Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Road-Gift-er”

[^2]: reading *abbho°* (BJTS) for *ambho°* (PTS).

[^3]: PTS reads the second line first, and the first line second; I follow BJTS. In the second line, I read *sīsa muddhani* (BJTS) for *lāsaŋ muddhani* (“shining on his head”).

[^4]: “Floral Canopy” or “Covered with Flowers”. PTS reads *Pupphachadaniya.*
