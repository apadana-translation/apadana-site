*\[462. {465.}*[^1] *Sumanatālavaṇṭiya*[^2]*\]*  
I gave a fan of palmyra,[^3]  
covered with jasmine flowers, to  
Siddhattha, the Blessed One, \[and\]  
bore it \[for\] the Greatly Famed One. (1) \[4884\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave that palmyra fan then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of palmyra fans. (2) \[4885\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[4886\]

My being in Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[4887\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4888\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sumanatālavaṇṭiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sumanatālavaṇṭiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Jasmine-Palmyra-Fan-er.” This same *apadāna* (with the slight
    difference that the third and fourth verses are inverted there)
    appears above, under the same name, as \#375 \[378\]

[^3]: the palmyra (*tāla,* Sinh. *tal*) tree or fan palm is Borassus
    flabelliformis
