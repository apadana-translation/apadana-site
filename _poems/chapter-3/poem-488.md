### \[485. {488.}[^1] Taraṇiya[^2]\]

Atthadassi, the Blessed One,  
the Self-Become One, World-Leader,  
the Thus-Gone-One then came up to  
the banks of river Vinatā.[^3] (1) \[5177\]

A water-dwelling[^4] tortoise then,  
\[I had\] come out from the water.  
I went up to the World-Leader,  
the Buddha; he desired to cross. (2) \[5178\]

“Let the Buddha climb onto me,  
O Atthadassi, O Great Sage;  
I will carry you across; you  
are the Ender of Suffering.” (3) \[5179\]

Discerning what I was thinking,  
Atthadassi, the Greatly Famed,  
after climbing onto my back,  
stood \[there\], the Leader of the World. (4) \[5180\]

As far back as I remember,[^5]  
ever since I reached discretion,[^6]  
I have not had such happiness  
as when his soles \[then\] touched[^7] \[my back\]. (5) \[5181\]

After crossing, the Sambuddha,  
Atthadassi, the Greatly Famed,  
remaining on the river bank,  
spoke these verses \[about me then\]: (6) \[5182\]

“Just as I ferry folks across  
the stream of doubt which is the mind,  
this turtle king, full of merit,  
ferries me across \[the river\]. (7) \[5183\]

Through this Buddha-ferrying and  
practice of loving-heartedness,  
for eighteen hundred aeons he  
will delight in the world of gods. (8) \[5184\]

Coming \[back\] here from the gods’ world,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
sitting down on a single seat,  
he’ll cross over the stream of doubt. (9) \[5185\]

As with a seed which is planted,  
in a field which is bountiful:[^8]  
when it rains,[^9] with proper support,[^10]  
fruit pleases the cultivator;  
so too \[within\] this Buddha-field,  
preached by the Sammāsambuddha:  
when it rains,[^11] with proper support,  
the fruit will be pleasing to me.” (10-11) \[5186-5187\]

I am one bent on exertion,  
calmed,[^12] devoid of grounds for rebirth,[^13]  
knowing well all the defilements,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled. (12) \[5188\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I did that karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of ferrying. (13) \[5189\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (14) \[5190\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (15) \[5191\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (16) \[5192\]

Thus indeed Venerable Taraṇiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Taraṇiya Thera is finished.

However, in the parallel verses below (5-6 of \#499, Ekapattadāyaka, <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reads *pavassante*). “Raining” is a frequent metaphor for *Dhamma*-preaching, and it would be possible to construe the second *pāda* that way, “when it rains the preaching of the Sammāsambuddha, with proper support…”
