### \[157. Tiṇasulaka[^1]\]

In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain, Bhūtagaṇa.[^2]  
One \[Lonely\] Victor did live there,  
Self-Become, a World-Rejecter. (1) \[2027\]

Having taken jasmine flowers  
I offered \[them\] to the Buddha.  
One less than a lakh of aeons  
I did not fall back \[in rebirth\].[^3] (2) \[2028\]

In the eleventh aeon hence  
\[I\] was one Dharaṇīruha,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2029\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2030\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tiṇasulaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tiṇasulaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “*Tiṇasula* (or *Tiṇasūla*) Flower-er”. This is a form of jasmine, “Arabian jasmine,” Sinhala *bōlidda*.

[^2]: “Group of Ghosts”

[^3]: the text abbreviates the standard claim of not having experienced any ill-state, but that still seems to be the sense here: for 99,999 aeons he did not fall back into hell or animal births. This is also how BJTS Sinhala gloss understands the term *avinipātaka*.

[^4]: “Growing from the Earth,” “Tree”.
