### \[417. {420.}[^1] Mañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>adāyaka[^2]\]

When Siddhattha reached nirvana,  
Compassionate One, World-Leader,  
\[and\] spread throughout the \[entire\] world,[^3]  
gods and men were honoring \[him,\] (1) \[4449\]

I was a low-born person[^4] there,  
a maker of long-chairs and stools.  
I \[earn my\] living through that work,  
\[and\] through it I feed \[my\] children. (2) \[4450\]

Having made a well-made long-chair,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands,  
approaching by myself, I \[then\]  
gave \[it\] to the monks’ Assembly. (3) \[4451\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (4) \[4452\]

Being gone to the world of gods,  
I joy in the group of thirty.[^5]  
Very expensive beds come to  
be, according to \[my\] wishes. (5) \[4453\]

Fifty times the lord of the gods,  
I exercised divine rule \[there\].  
And eighty times I was a king,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (6) \[4454\]

There was \[also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting.  
I’m \[always\] happy and famous:  
that’s the fruit of giving a bed. (7) \[4455\]

If, falling from the world of gods,  
I come into the human state,  
very costly, excellent beds  
come to be for me by themselves. (8) \[4456\]

This is the final time for me;  
\[my\] last rebirth is proceeding.[^6]  
Even now, when it’s time to lie  
down, a bed is waiting for me. (9) \[4457\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that gift at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving a bed. (10) \[4458\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (11) \[4459\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[4460\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (13) \[4461\]

Thus indeed Venerable Mañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>adāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Mañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>adāyaka Thera is finished.
