### \[29. Ekañjalika[^1]\]

I saw the golden Sambuddha  
as he traveled through the bazaar,  
Vipassi, Top Caravan Leader,  
Hero Among Men, the \[Great\] Guide,[^2]  
Untamed-Tamer,[^3] the Neutral One,  
Great Debater, the Sage So Great,  
\[and\] pleased, with happiness of mind,  
I pressed my hands together once. (1-2) \[994-995\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I pressed my hands together \[once,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that is the fruit of saluting. (3) \[996\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[997\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekañjalika Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekañjalika Thera is finished.

[^1]: “One-Salute”

[^2]: *vināyakaŋ*

[^3]: *adantadamanaŋ*, could mean either “tamer of the untamed” or “tamer who is untamed;” I leave the ambiguity open with the hyphen, admitting here my preference for “tamer of the untamed” (which is also the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reading; cf. RD on *dametar*), and recommend pronunciation in chanting which through stress on the first term in the compound, and tone, can emphasize that the Buddha is one who tames those who are untamed/feral.
