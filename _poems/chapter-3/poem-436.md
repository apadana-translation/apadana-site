*\[433. {436.}*[^1] *Kalambadāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
The Sambuddha[^3] named Romasa[^4]  
was living on a mountainside.  
I gave bindweed[^5] to that \[Buddha\],  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands. (1) \[4679\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave that donation back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] bindweed. (2) \[4680\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4681\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4682\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4683\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kalambadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kalambadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Stalk of Sugar-Cane-er” BJTS reads *Ucchukhaṇḍika* (“a broken
    bit/a stick of sugar-cane”)

[^3]: BJTS takes him as a Lonely (*pacceka,* Sinh. *pasē*) Buddha, even
    though the text is unambiguous in labelling him a Sambuddha.

[^4]: see above, note to \#226, v. 4 (BJTS v. 2404) for a discussion of
    possible meanings and details of the use of this name elsewhere in
    *Apadāna*.

[^5]: *kalamba,* RD draws attention to Skt. *kalambika, kalambuka, =*
    convulvulus repens*,* bindweed, but there are other possibilities
    including the tree menispermum calumba (but its fruits are
    poisonous/only used in controlled medical usages, unlikely?) and
    (following BJTS Sinh. gloss on \[169\] and \[4005\]) Anthocephalus
    Cadamba *(Rub.)*, Sinh. *kalamba.* BJTS Sinh. gloss here is
    *vilapalā*, “edible greens from a lake\[side\],” which accords with
    the context whatever the actual plant was (or would be called in
    English). An alternative, and reasonable translation might be “wild
    greens” or “edible greens”
