### \[20. Sumaṅgala\]

Wishing to make a sacrifice  
I had a meal prepared \[back then\]  
\[and\] stood in a large *mālaka*[^1]  
venerating the brahmins \[there\]. (1) \[796\]

And then I saw the Sambuddha,  
Piyadassi, Greatly Famed One,  
who was the Tamer of All Worlds,[^2]  
the Self-Become, the Neutral One. (2) \[797\]

Standing before his followers  
that Blessed One, really shining,  
\[was\] blazing forth just like the sun  
when entering its chariot. (3) \[798\]

Pressing my hands together \[then\]  
\[and\] bringing \[my\] own heart pleasure,  
I invited \[him\] with my mind:  
“Let the Great Sage come \[to me now\].” (4) \[799\]

Discerning what I was thinking,  
he who was Peerless in the World,  
Teacher, with a thousand arahants  
came \[right\] up to my doorway \[then\]. (5) \[800\]

“Praise to you, O Well-Bred Person![^3]  
Praise to you, Ultimate Person!  
Ascending into \[my\] palace  
please sit upon the lion-throne.” (6) \[801\]

The Tame One, with Tamed Retinue,  
Crossed Over,[^4] the Best Ferryman[^5]  
ascending into \[my\] palace  
sat down upon that seat superb. (7) \[802\]

Foodstuffs which had been presented  
that \[still\] remained in my own house  
I \[then\] gifted to the Buddha  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[my\] own hands. (8) \[803\]

With a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind,  
joyful,[^6] with hands pressed together,  
I worshipped the Best of Buddhas:  
“O! The Buddha’s \[great\] eminence! (9) \[804\]

Many arahants are among these  
nobles being served \[and\] eating.[^7]  
That is your majestic power;  
I \[too\] go for refuge in you.” (10) \[805\]

Piyadassi the Blessed One  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
sat down in the monks’ Assembly  
\[and\] uttered these verses \[aloud\]: (11) \[806\]

\[Of\] he who fed the Assembly  
\[which is\] upright \[and\] attentive  
and the Sambuddha, Thus-Gone-One,  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (12) \[807\]

Twenty-seven times \[a god-king\]  
he will exercise divine rule.  
With pleasure in his own karma  
he’ll delight in the world of gods. (13) \[808\]

And also eighteen times he’ll be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\].  
He will reside upon the earth  
\[and\] have five hundred earthly reigns.” (14) \[809\]

Plunged into the woods, the forest,  
a tiger-frequented jungle,  
having put forth great exertion  
I destroyed \[all\] the defilements. (15) \[810\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I gave \[him\] that gift back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that is the fruit of giving food. (16) \[811\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (17) \[812\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sumaṅgala Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sumaṅgala Thera is finished.
