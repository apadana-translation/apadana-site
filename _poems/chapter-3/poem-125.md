### \[125. Sammukhāthavika[^1]\]

When Vipassi \[Buddha\] was born,  
I interpreted the omens:  
“A Buddha is born in the world;  
he’ll make people reach nirvana.” (1) \[1806\]

And when that one was being born,  
the ten-thousand world-system quaked.  
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,  
Eyeful One is preaching *Dhamma*. (2) \[1807\]

And when that one was being born,  
there was a vast effulgence \[there\].  
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,  
Eyeful One is preaching *Dhamma*. (3) \[1808\]

And when that one was being born,  
\[all\] the rivers \[then\] stopped flowing.  
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,  
Eyeful One is preaching *Dhamma*. (4) \[1809\]

And when that one was being born,  
\[all\] the fires of hell stopped burning.  
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,  
Eyeful One is preaching *Dhamma*. (5) \[1810\]

And when that one was being born,  
\[all\] the flocks of birds stopped flying.  
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,  
Eyeful One is preaching *Dhamma*. (6) \[1811\]

And when that one was being born,  
\[the powerful\] winds stopped blowing.  
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,  
Eyeful One is preaching *Dhamma*. (7) \[1812\]

And when that one was being born,  
all the gemstones were glistening.  
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,  
Eyeful One is preaching *Dhamma*. (8) \[1813\]

And when that one was being born,  
\[his first\] seven steps were taken.  
Now that Blessed One, the Teacher,  
Eyeful One is preaching *Dhamma*. (9) \[1814\]

And when the Sambuddha was born,  
he surveyed all the directions.  
and \[then he\] spoke majestic words;  
that is the nature of Buddhas.” (10) \[1815\]

After he made people feel moved,  
\[and\] I had praised the World-Leader,  
having worshipped the Sambuddha,  
I departed facing the east. (11) \[1816\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I praised the Buddha in that way,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of praising \[him\]. (12) \[1817\]

In the ninetieth aeon hence  
\[the king\] Sammukhāthavika,[^2]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (13) \[1818\]

In the eighty-ninth aeon hence,  
\[the king\] Paṭhavidundubhi[^3]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (14) \[1819\]

In the eighty-eighth aeon hence,  
the king[^4] named Obhāsamata[^5]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength  
possessor of the seven gems. (15) \[1820\]

In the eighty-seventh aeon,  
\[the king\] Sarita<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chedana[^6]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength  
possessor of the seven gems. (16) \[1821\]

In the eighty-sixth aeon \[hence,\]  
\[the king\] Agginibbāpana[^7]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (17) \[1822\]

In the eighty-fifth aeon \[hence,\]  
\[the king\] Rājāvātasama[^8]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (18) \[1823\]

In the eighty-fourth aeon \[hence,\]  
\[the king\] Gatipa<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chedana[^9]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (19) \[1824\]

In the eighty-third aeon \[hence,\]  
\[the king\] Ratanappajjala[^10]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (20) \[1825\]

In the eighty-second aeon,  
\[the king\] Padavikkamaṇa[^11]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (21) \[1826\]

In the eighty-first aeon \[hence,\]  
\[the king\] Rājāvilokana[^12]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (22) \[1827\]

In the eightieth aeon \[hence,\]  
the king[^13] known as Hirisāra[^14]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (23) \[1828\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (24) \[1829\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sammukhāthavika Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sammukhāthavika Thera is finished.
