### \[143. Vedikāraka[^1]\]

When the World’s Lord reached nirvana,  
Piyadassi, Ultimate Man,  
with a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind,  
I made the Buddha a railing. (1) \[1950\]

Having surrounded it with gems  
I made that ultimate \[rail then\],  
and having made that great railing  
I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (2) \[1951\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
gemstones are carried in the sky:  
that is the fruit of good karma. (3) \[1952\]

In the sixteenth aeon ago  
there were thirty-two \[different\] kings,  
\[all\] wheel-turners with great power,  
\[and they were\] named Maṇippabhā.[^2] (4) \[1953\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1954\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vedikāraka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Vedikāraka Thera is finished.
