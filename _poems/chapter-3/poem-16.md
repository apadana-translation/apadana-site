*\[16. Rāhula\]*  
I gifted a mirrored surface[^1]  
in the seven-story palace  
of Blessed Padumuttara  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One. (1) \[741\]

The Biped-Lord, the Bull of Men,  
the Great Sage \[then\] surrounded by  
a thousand \[arahants\] undefiled  
proceeded to \[his\] perfumed hut. (2) \[742\]

Standing in the monks’ Assembly,  
\[and\] lighting up that perfumed hut,  
the God of Gods, the Bull of Men,  
the Teacher, spoke these verses \[then\]: (3) \[743\]

“I shall relate details of him  
who would cause this \[palace\][^2] to shine  
\[with\] a mirror well spread out \[here\];  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (4) \[744\]

Things made of gold, things of silver,  
things made of lapis lazuli;  
whatever things he wishes for[^3]  
will arise in the sky \[for him\]. (5) \[745\]

Sixty-four times the king of gods  
he will exercise divine rule;  
a thousand times he’s going to be  
a wheel-turner, without a break. (6) \[746\]

In the twenty-first aeon \[hence\]  
the Kṣatriyan named Vimala[^4]  
victorious on \[all\] four sides  
will be a wheel-turning monarch. (7) \[747\]

\[His\] city, called Reṇuvatī,[^5]  
will be well-fashioned out of tile.  
\[Each side\] three hundred \[leagues\] in length  
will be joined rectangularly. (8) \[748\]

\[His\] palace named Sudassana[^6]  
constructed by Vissakamma[^7]  
will be furnished with gabled cells  
studded with seven kinds of gems. (9) \[749\]

Filled with divine musicians,[^8]  
\[and never\] lacking the ten sounds;  
it will be like Sudassana,  
the city where the gods reside.[^9] (10) \[750\]

\[Even\] when its radiance dims,  
as though the sun were rising \[then\]  
it will be made to shine brightly  
eight leagues in every direction. (11) \[751\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (12) \[752\]

Falling from Tusitā \[heaven\],  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
he’ll be the legitimate son  
of Gotama the Blessed One. (13) \[753\]

If he should remain in the house  
\[then\] he would be a wheel-turner.  
For that \[reason\] an arahant[^10] can’t  
obtain pleasure within the house. (14) \[754\]

Being well-trained he will renounce  
after going forth from the house.  
He will be known as Rāhula  
\[and\] he will become an arahant.” (15) \[755\]

“As a blue jay protects its eggs  
\[and\] as an ox \[protects\] its tail,  
so too,[^11] Great Sage, I being wise  
and moral did protect \[virtue\]. (16) \[756\]

Understanding his Teaching, I  
lived loving \[his\] dispensation.  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
without defilements I \[now\] live.[]{#BookmarkCopy1 .anchor} (17)
\[757\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (18) \[758\]

Thus indeed Venerable Rāhula Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Venerable Rāhula Thera is finished.

[^1]: *santharaŋ* (PTS) or *santhariṃ* (BJTS, cty) literally means
    “spread out” or a mat. Cty clarifies that this mirror was a mirrored
    surface (*ādāsa-talam*), though it reads *santharim* as a gerund
    (*santaritvā*) meaning “produced” (*nipphādetvā*), “having produced
    a mirror I gave it”. This seems unnecessary (as well as
    ungrammatical) if we take the reading *santharaṃ*, “a spread out
    \[mirror\]”.

[^2]: PTS has *jotito* (m. nom. sing) but I follow cty and BJTS in
    reading *jotitā* (f. nom. sing), to agree with “palace” (*pāsādā*),
    which seems to be what *ayam* (m. or f. nom. sing.) refers to.

[^3]: lit., “whatever things are beloved to his mind”

[^4]: “Stainless”

[^5]: “Full of Pollen”

[^6]: Good to Look At”

[^7]: Vishwakarma, “the divine architect”

[^8]: v*ijjādhara*° = Skt. vi*dyādhara*°, divine musicians (or here too
    “spell-knowers,” sorcerers?)

[^9]: lit., the gods’ city, metri causa

[^10]: *tādī*, one who is neutral in terms of likes and dislikes,
    translated as the Neutral One or sometimes as the Such-like One when
    it’s a Buddha epithet.

[^11]: reading *evaṃ* (cty, BJTS) for *mamaŋ* (PTS)
