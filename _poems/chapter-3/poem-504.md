*\[501. {504.}*[^1] *Avaṭaphaliya*[^2]*\]*  
The Blessed One, Hundred-Rayed One,[^3]  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
rising up from \[his\] solitude,  
went forth in order to seek food. (1) \[5414\]

\[Holding\] fruit in \[my\] hand, I saw  
the Bull of Men who had approached.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I gave \[him\] fruit with stems removed. (2) \[5415\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that fruit \[at that time\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[5416\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5417\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5418\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5419\]

Thus indeed Venerable Avaṭaphaliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Avaṭaphaliya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: here BJTS and PTS agree on the spelling*.* The meaning is
    “Stemless Fruit-er.” This same *apadāna* (with only very slight
    differences) appears above, titled *Avaṇṭaphaladāyaka*-*apadāna*, as
    \#378 \[381\], and titled *Avaṇṭaphaliyaº* (there PTS
    *Avaṭaphaliyaº*), as \#463 {466}*.* In the present *apadāna* the
    order of the refrain verses matches \#463 {466} but is inverted from
    \#378 {381}; and the third foot of the first verse varies from that
    in both of the parallel first verses. Virtually the same *apadāna*
    is also presented as \#506 {509}, below, with the title
    *Tālaphaliya.* It varies from the present one only in the fourth
    foot of the second verse, where “with stems removed” is replaced by
    “palmyra”. It is repeated again as {555}, below, and ascribed to the
    historical monk Vajjīputta. Note Lilley’s note on PTS colophonic
    title here, not only that its own alt. S-1 reads *Avaṇṭaº* but also
    “*The following* apadāna *is missing in G., and the* Thera’s *name
    is attached to this* apadāna*.” *
