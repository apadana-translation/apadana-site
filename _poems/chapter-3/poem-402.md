*\[399. {402.}*[^1] *Puṇṇaka*[^2]*\]*  
The Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
the Buddha, who had an illness,  
was living amidst the mountains,  
near the top of a mountain slope. (1) \[3919\]

All around my hermitage \[there,\]  
when Buddha was passing away,[^3]  
there was shouting out all the time,  
there was \[brilliant\] light all the time. (2) \[3920\]

Throughout that forest grove all the  
bears[^4] and wolves,[^5] *kara bānā* bears,[^6]  
the tigers[^7] and the lions too,  
are roaring loudly all the time. (3) \[3921\]

After seeing those strange omens[^8]  
I ascended[^9] the mountain slope.  
There I saw \[him\], the Sambuddha,  
passed away,[^10] the Unconquered One,  
like a regal *sal* tree in bloom,  
like the risen hundred-rayed \[sun\],  
aglow like charcoal \[that’s still hot\],  
passed away,[^11] the Unconquered One. (4-5) \[3922-3923\]  
Making it full of grass and sticks,  
I \[then\] made a pyre \[for him\] there.  
Having made \[that\] well-fashioned pyre,  
I cremated \[the Buddha’s\] corpse. (6) \[3924\]

After I’d cremated \[his\] corpse,  
I sprinkled scented water \[there\].  
A spirit[^12] standing in the sky  
fixed a name for me for all time: (7) \[3925\]

“That[^13] duty was fulfilled by you  
for the Great Sage, the Self-Become.  
O sage you’re always going to be  
named “the full one”[^14] \[in each lifetime\].” (8) \[3926\]

After falling from that body,  
I went to the world of the gods.  
There a divinely-made perfume[^15]  
is \[then\] exuded in the sky. (9) \[3927\]

Even in that \[world of gods\] the  
name assigned me was “the full one.”[^16]  
\[Whether\] born human or divine,  
I fulfill \[all\] my intentions. (10) \[3928\]

This is the final time for me;  
\[my\] last rebirth is proceeding.[^17]  
And here as well “the full one” is  
the name assigned me \[that’s\] well known. (11) \[3929\]

Having regaled the Sambuddha,  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled. (12) \[3930\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of duties for the corpse. (13) \[3931\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled.[]{#BookmarkCopy1 .anchor} (14) \[3932\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (15) \[3933\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (16) \[3934\]

Thus indeed Venerable Puṇṇaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Puṇṇaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Full One,” a historical monk, to whom the *Puṇṇovāda Sutta* (M.
    iii. 267ff.;S. iv. 60 ff) was preached. Cty (p. 484) says he was the
    leader of an army of yakkhas, but I do not see that detail in the
    extant text.

    *valassu,* Note BJTS omits the second mention of “wolves” so may be
    taking *koka* in compound with *taracchā* (i.e., *kokataracchā*), in
    specifying this particular type of bear (cf. Sorata, *kara baāna
    valasā,* s.v.)  
[^7]: reading *vyagghā* with BJTS for PTS *vālā* (= *vāḷā*, snakes?)

    the plural is obviously implied as three strange omens have been
    mentioned.
