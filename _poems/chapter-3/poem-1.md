# The Legends of the Theras

Now listen to the legends of the Theras:

### \[I. Sāriputta\]

Close to the Himalayan range  
\[on\] the mountain called Lambaka[^1]  
my ashram is very well made,  
a well-constructed hall of leaves. (1) \[140\]

There’s a river, with gentle banks  
well-fixed, delightful to the mind  
and strewn about with bright white sand  
not very far from my ashram. (2) \[141\]

Free of gravel \[and\] free of slopes,  
excellent, without bad odors,  
the river flows right past that place,  
making my ashram beautiful. (3) \[142\]

Crocodiles[^2] and leviathans,[^3]  
alligators[^4] and tortoises;  
the river flows right past that place,  
making my ashram beautiful. (4) \[143\]

Sheatfish,[^5] *pāvusa,*[^6] *valaja,*[^7]  
reed-fish,[^8] red-fish[^9] and *maggura*[^10]  
are flowing \[with the current\][^11] \[there\],  
making my ashram beautiful. (5) \[144\]

Trees that blossom and trees that fruit  
stand on both banks of that river  
overhanging it from both sides  
making my ashram beautiful. (6) \[145\]

Mango, *sal*[^12] and coral-bean tree*,*[^13]  
trumpet-flower*,*[^14] Chinese chaste tree,[^15]  
trees in flower with heavenly scents  
are perfuming my ashram \[then\]. (7) \[146\]

Sandal, *salalā,*[^16] cheesewood[^17] too  
ironwood,[^18] laurel[^19] and screw-pine[^20]  
trees in flower with heavenly scents  
are perfuming my ashram \[then\]. (8) \[147\]

Hiptage[^21] vines and ashoka trees,[^22]  
*bhaginimāla* flowering,  
sage-leaf alangium,[^23] and red  
*bimbijāl*[^24] bloom in my ashram. (9) \[148\]

*Ketaka,*[^25] *kandali*[^26] flowers,  
*kebuka,* and Arab jasmine[^27]  
are exuding heavenly scents  
making my ashram beautiful. (10) \[149\]

Dinner-plate tree[^28] and *kaṇika*  
Silver greywood,[^29] many Black trees[^30]  
are exuding heavenly scents,  
making my ashram beautiful. (11) \[150\]

Laurel[^31] and mountain laurel[^32] trees,  
and ebony,[^33] all blossoming,  
are exuding heavenly scents  
making my ashram beautiful. (12) \[151\]

Golden shower,[^34] winter cherry,[^35]  
kadam[^36] and Spanish cherry[^37] trees  
are exuding heavenly scents  
making my ashram beautiful. (13) \[152\]

*Ālaka* and *isimugga*,  
banana,[^38] also citron[^39] trees  
matured on the sweet-smelling water  
are bearing forth their flowers \[there\]. (14) \[153\]

Some pink lotuses are blooming,  
others are producing pollen,[^40]  
some pink lotuses are budding,  
always flowering in the tank.[^41] (15) \[154\]

Pink lotuses germinate \[there\];[^42]  
the lotus roots[^43] are being cleansed.[^44]  
*Singhāṭi*[^45] leaves are strew about,  
making that tank so beautiful. (16) \[155\]

Shrubs like *nayita*, *ambagandh*,  
*uttuli, bandhujīvaka*[^46]  
all in bloom then in the tank \[there\]  
are exuding heavenly scents. (17) \[156\]

Sheatfish,[^47] also *pāvusa*[^48] fish,  
*valaja,*[^49] reed-fish[^50] \[and\] red-fish[^51]  
and *sankula*[^52] and *maggura*[^53]  
are living in that tank \[there\] then. (18) \[157\]

Crocodiles and alligators,  
*tantiggāha* and *rakkhasa*,  
*ogaha*[^54] and also pythons[^55]  
are living in that tank \[there\] then. (19) \[158\]

Pigeons[^56] and *ravi*-swans[^57] as well,  
ruddy geese[^58] and *nadīcara*\s,  
cuckoos,[^59] parrots,[^60] and mynah birds[^61] too  
are living on that lake \[there then\]. (20) \[159\]

In the forest wild jungle fowl,[^62]  
golden crabs,[^63] lake-swallows[^64] \[too\],  
lapwings[^65] and Ceylon lorikeets,[^66]  
are living on that lake \[there then\]. (21) \[160\]

Swans[^67] \[and\] curlews[^68] and peacocks[^69] too,  
cuckoos[^70] and jungle fowl[^71] as well,  
small monkeys[^72] and pheasants[^73]  
are living on that lake \[there then\]. (22) \[161\]

Owls[^74] and *poṭṭhasīsa*\s[^75] \[too\],  
numerous hawks,[^76] also osprey,[^77]  
and also *mahākāḷa* birds  
are living on that lake \[there then\]. (23) \[162\]

Spotted deer[^78] and also wild boar,[^79]  
and numerous wolves[^80] and jackals,[^81]  
*rohicca-*deer,[^82] *suggapota*\s  
are living on that lake \[there then\]. (24) \[163\]

Lions and tigers and leopards,  
bears[^83] \[and\] wolves,[^84] *kara bānā* bears,[^85]  
and thrice-rutting[^86] *mātaṅgas*[^87] \[too\]  
are living on that lake \[there then\]. (25) \[164\]

Centaurs[^88] and monkeys[^89] are there too  
and folks who work in the forest,[^90]  
servant-boys[^91] as well as hunters,[^92]  
are living on that lake \[there then\]. (26) \[165\]

Wild mangosteen,[^93] Chirauli-nut,[^94]  
Mahuwa*,*[^95] *kāsumāriya*[^96]  
are bearing never-ending fruit  
not very far from my ashram. (27) \[166\]

Margosa*,*[^97] *salalā,*[^98] yellow  
cheesewoods[^99] with such excellent fruit  
are constantly bearing those fruits  
not very far from my ashram. (28) \[167\]

Myrobalan[^100] and gooseberry,[^101]  
mango, rose-apple,[^102] bahera,[^103]  
jujube,[^104] markingnut,[^105] bel[^106]—  
they constantly are bearing fruit. (29) \[168\]

Bindweed,[^107] also titan arum,[^108]  
*bilāni*,[^109] *takkaḷāni* \[bulbs\]  
*jīvaka* and *sahaka*[^110] \[plants\]  
are abundant in my ashram. (30) \[169\]

That well-created tank is there  
not very far from the ashram,  
with clear water, cool for drinking,  
well-fixed, delightful to the mind. (31) \[170\]

Covered with pink and blue lotus,  
combined with white lotus flowers  
and covered again with *mandālaka*[^111]  
it exudes a heavenly scent. (32) \[171\]

At that time I was then living  
in that well-made, lovely ashram  
in the woods blooming and fruiting  
and thus endowed with everything. (33) \[172\]

I was ascetic Saruci  
of noble-conduct, vow-taker,  
a meditator, trance-lover,  
strong[^112] in the five special knowledges.[^113] (34) \[173\]

Four and twenty thousand students  
were waiting upon me back then.  
They all were from the Brahmin caste,  
of noble birth and glorious. (35) \[174\]

They’d reached perfection in my teachings  
of grammar and vocabulary,  
of synonyms and metrics too,  
and reading signs, and history. (36) \[175\]

They were skilled as interpreters  
of events and omens and signs  
on the earth and ground, in the sky;  
my students were very well-trained. (37) \[176\]

Satisfied they were, and prudent;  
ate little food, had no desires.  
Happy if receiving or not,  
they always gathered around me. (38) \[177\]

Meditators, trance-lovers,  
wise, attentive, with peaceful minds,  
with wishes for \[only\] nothing,  
they always gathered around me. (39) \[178\]

Masters of[^114] special knowledges,  
delighting in their Brahmin ways,[^115]  
able to fly through the sky, most wise,  
they always gathered around me. (40) \[179\]

They kept the six sense-doors well-closed  
were lust-free, with guarded sense-organs,  
\[most\] wise, and not tied down at home:[^116]  
no one came close to my students.[^117] (41) \[180\]

At night they always passed the time  
\[meditating\] seated cross-legged  
or walking back and forth in place;  
no one came close to my students. (42) \[181\]

Not aroused in what’s arousing,  
nor defiled in what’s defiling;  
not fooling self in foolish things:  
no one came close to my students. (43) \[182\]

They spent all \[their\] time studying  
\[all\] the miraculous powers.  
They could set the earth to quaking  
with haughtiness none could approach. (44) \[183\]

When those students were playing sports  
they sported in the altered states,  
brought rose-apples from \[distant\] trees;[^118]  
no one came close to my students. (45) \[184\]

Some would travel to Goyāna,  
others to Pubbavideha,  
and some to Utturukuru:  
no one came close to my students. (46) \[185\]

They’d send their requisites[^119] ahead  
and then they’d proceed after \[them\];  
the sky was totally covered  
by twenty-four thousand \[students\]. (47) \[186\]

Some ate cooked food and some ate raw,  
some ground with teeth, others with mortars.  
Some ate food that they ground on stone,  
some only fruits that had fallen. (48) \[187\]

Some \[bathed\] getting into water,  
\[others\] loved the pure evening \[rain\]  
\[while others\] bathed sprinkling water:  
no one came close to my students. (49) \[188\]

With nails and armpit hair grown long,  
muck in \[their\] teeth, heads \[soiled\] with dirt  
and perfumed \[only\] with precepts:[^120]  
no one came close to my students. (50) \[189\]

Those famed matted-haired ascetics  
would assemble in the morning,  
saying what they’d received, and not,  
then set off \[flying\] through the air. (51) \[190\]

A mighty din would issue forth  
from them as they were taking off.  
The gods would be most delighted  
by that sound of \[their\] deer-hide robes. (52) \[191\]

Traveling in all directions  
those sages, flying through the sky  
would go to any place they wished  
by means of their own \[vast\] power. (53) \[192\]

They could set the earth to quaking;  
all of them were sky-travelers.  
Famed ascetics, hard to conquer,  
they were steady like the ocean. (54) \[193\]

Some walked back and forth meditating  
some sages did so while seated,  
some of them lived on fallen-fruits;  
no one came close to my students. (55) \[194\]

They dwelt always in states of love  
and were kindly to all creatures.  
None of them raised his own self up  
and they felt hatred toward no one. (56) \[195\]

Fearless like the king of lions,  
mighty like an elephant king,  
hard to approach like a tiger  
they would come into my presence. (57) \[196\]

Sorcerers[^121] and \[their\] deities,[^122]  
cobra-gods,[^123] music-nymphs,[^124] demons,[^125]  
fairies,[^126] titans[^127] \[and\] *garuḷa*\s  
are living on that lake. (58) \[197\]

Those dread-locked requisite-bearers[^128]  
dressed in superb deer-leather \[clothes\],  
all those sages, sky-travelers,  
are living on that lake \[there then\]. (59) \[198\]

As is always appropriate  
they respected one another.  
From twenty-four thousand students  
not the sound of a sneeze[^129] is heard. (60) \[199\]

One foot placed after the other[^130]  
making little sound, self-controlled,  
all of them, after they’d come close  
are worshipping me with their heads. (61) \[200\]

Thus surrounded by those students  
peaceful, doing austerities,  
I \[then\] dwelt in that ashram there  
meditator, trance-lover. (62) \[201\]

My ashram was always perfumed  
by those sages’ morality  
and the scents of both blooming flowers  
and the different fruits \[that grew there\]. (63) \[202\]

By night and day I never know  
displeasure, nor does it come to me.  
Giving my students instruction,  
I am constantly filled with joy.[^131] (64) \[203\]

The blossoming of many flowers  
and ripening[^132] of many fruits  
are exuding heavenly scents  
making my ashram beautiful. (65) \[204\]

Arising from meditation[^133]  
I’m zealous and intelligent.  
Taking ascetics’ requisites  
I proceeded into the woods. (66) \[205\]

I was well-trained to read the signs  
surrounding births and portents \[too\].  
At that time I’d \[fully\] mastered[^134]  
all the mantras in existence. (67) \[206\]

Anomadassi, Blessed One,  
the World’s Best, the Bull Among Men,  
the Buddha, seeking solitude  
entered the Himalayas \[then\]. (68) \[207\]

Going into Himalaya  
the Supreme, Compassionate Sage,  
getting into lotus posture[^135]  
sat down, the Ultimate Person. (69) \[208\]

\[Then\] I saw that Sambuddha \[there\],  
shining light, a mental delight,  
bright like a blue water lily,[^136]  
blazing up like a fire-altar. (70) \[209\]

I saw the Leader of the World  
like a regal *sal* tree in bloom;  
blazing forth like a tree of lamps;  
lightening flaring in a cloud-bank. (71) \[210\]

“This *nāga* is the Great Hero,  
the Sage who ended suffering;”  
after coming to see this one  
all suffering was cast away. (72) \[211\]

After seeing that God of Gods  
adorned with the auspicious marks  
I thought, “is he Buddha or not?  
Surely I’m seeing One with Eyes.” (73) \[212\]

One thousand wheel-marks are seen  
on his unsurpassed \[lovely\] foot.  
I, having seen those marks of his,  
concluded he’s the Thus-Gone-One. (74) \[213\]

I brought in a broom for sweeping  
and having done the sweeping then  
I gathered eight blooming flowers  
for *pūjā* to that Best Buddha. (75) \[214\]

After *pūjā* to that Buddha,  
the Flood-Crosser, Undefiled One,  
placing deer-hide on one shoulder  
I worshipped the Chief of the World. (76) \[215\]

“The knowledge by which the Buddha  
dwells without \[any\] defilements—  
that knowledge I shall now proclaim;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words! (77) \[216\]

May you lift this world up rightly  
Self-Become One, Boundless Increase![^137]  
Coming into the sight of you  
they cross the rushing stream of doubt. (78) \[217\]

You’re the Teacher for those who breathe,  
the Banner, the Flag and the Pole;  
you are the Goal, the Solid Ground,  
the Island,[^138] the Best of Bipeds. (79) \[218\]

It’s possible to measure the  
ocean’s water by the gallon[^139]  
but not ever could one measure  
your knowledge, O Omniscient One. (80) \[219\]

It’s possible to lift the earth  
onto a comparable sphere  
but not ever could one measure  
your knowledge, O Omniscient One. (81) \[220\]

It’s possible to measure \[all\]  
space with a rope or by the inch  
but not ever could one measure  
your knowledge, O Omniscient One. (82) \[221\]

One might exhaust the entire earth  
and all the water in the sea  
but similes that might arise  
won’t befit the Buddha’s knowledge. (83) \[222\]

Whatever goes on in the minds  
of this world’s creatures, with its gods,  
O Eyeful One all those things too  
are sunk in your knowledge-water. (84) \[223\]

The knowledge by which you attained  
supreme complete Awakening:  
with that knowledge, Omniscient One,  
you crush rivals and heretics.” (85) \[224\]

Having praised with these \[nine\] verses,  
the ascetic named Suruci  
spreading out his deer-leather robe  
sat down \[right there\] upon the earth. (86) \[225\]

“They say the king of mountains rose  
to that height after being sunk  
in the great ocean for as long  
as eighty-four thousand aeons. (87) \[226\]

And Meru, having thus arisen,  
being so long and so spread out,  
bit by bit gets broken into  
two million lakhs[^140] \[of small pebbles\]. (88) \[227\]

If one should investigate it  
counting the numbers of lakhs \[there\]  
\[still\] he could not ever measure  
your knowledge, O Omniscient One. (89) \[228\]

Whichever water is encircled  
by water holes[^141] however small  
the beings who live in water  
would all \[find themselves\] submerged there. (90) \[229\]

In just that way, O Great Hero,  
these ordinary heretics  
who jump into dogmas’ grasp  
get deluded by what they touch. (91) \[230\]

These \[heretics\] pulled underwater  
by your knowledge which is pure and  
which is seen without obstruction  
never move beyond your knowledge.” (92) \[231\]

At that time \[he\], the Blessed One,  
Anomadassi, Greatly Famed  
arising from his meditation  
surveyed the \[whole\] world,[^142] that Victor. (93) \[232\]

Nisabha was a disciple  
of that Sage Anomadassi.  
He was surrounded by a lakh  
of peaceful-minded ones like him (94) \[233\]

who’d destroyed defilements, were pure,  
and had the six special knowledges.  
Discerning the Buddha’s wishes  
he then approached that World-Leader. (95) \[234\]

Standing up in the air right there  
they circumambulated him  
and praising with ten fingers pressed  
came down to the Buddha’s presence. (96) \[235\]

Anomadassi, Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
sitting in the monks’ Assembly  
\[right then\] made manifest a smile. (97) \[236\]

Varuṇa was the attendant  
on the Omniscient One, Great Sage.  
Putting \[my\] robe on one shoulder  
he then queried the World-Leader: (98) \[237\]

“O Blessed One, what is the cause  
of the Teacher’s \[breaking a\] smile?  
It never is without a cause  
that the Buddhas begin to smile.” (99) \[238\]

Anomadassi, Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly  
\[then\] spoke these verses \[in reply\]: (100) \[239\]

“This one who honors[^143] me with flowers  
and also extols my knowledge,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words.” (101) \[240\]

Knowing that Buddha would speak,[^144] the  
gods all came together \[there then\].  
Wishing to hear the great Teaching[^145]  
they \[then\] approached the Sambuddha. (102) \[241\]

Lesser gods in ten world-systems  
who possessed enormous powers  
wishing to hear the great Teaching  
also approached the Sambuddha. (103) \[242\]

\[He said\], “The army, with four parts—  
tusker, soldier, chariot, horse—  
will ceaselessly wait on this one;  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (104) \[243\]

Sixty thousand instruments[^146] \[and\]  
well-decorated kettle-drums[^147]  
will always pay respects to him;  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (105) \[244\]

Women numbering sixteen thousand,  
decked out in all the ornaments,  
with varied clothes and jewelry  
and wearing earrings made of gems (106)  
with long eyelashes, lovely smiles[^148]  
and slim waists, pleasant to look at[^149]  
will ceaselessly wait on this one:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (107) \[246\]

He’ll delight in the world of gods  
for one hundred thousand aeons.  
A thousand times he’s going to be  
the wheel-turning king of a country. (108) \[247\]

A thousand times the king of gods,  
he will exercise divine rule,  
\[and he will have\] much local rule  
innumerable by counting. (109) \[248\]

When he attains his final birth  
he will go to the human state.  
He will be borne out of the womb  
of the Brahmin woman Sāri. (110) \[249\]

Thenceforth this man will be known by  
the name of his maternal clan:  
his name will be Sāriputta;  
he will have sharp intelligence. (111) \[250\]

Giving up eight hundred million[^150]  
he will renounce, with nothing left,[^151]  
and searching for the path to peace  
this great man’s going to wander \[far\]. (112) \[251\]

Aeons beyond measure from now,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (113) \[252\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma’s* legitimate offspring,[^152]  
with the name of Sāriputta  
he will be the top disciple. (114) \[253\]

This river, the Bhāgīrathī,[^153]  
is fed by the Himalayas,  
rushes into the mighty sea,  
\[then\] satisfies the great ocean. (115) \[254\]

Just so this man, Sāriputta,  
wise one among the Sāketas  
attaining[^154] Wisdom’s Perfection  
will satisfy[^155] \[all\] living beings. (116) \[255\]

Going from the Himalayas  
to the sea, the mighty ocean,  
whatever sand lies in between  
cannot be fathomed by counting. (117) \[256\]

Without remainder he’ll be able  
to fathom that by counting thus;  
but there will be no upper limit  
to Sāriputta’s \[own\] wisdom. (118) \[257\]

Counting by hundreds of thousands  
one would exhaust the Ganges’s sands;  
but there will be no upper limit  
to Sāriputta’s \[own\] wisdom. (119) \[258\]

The waves upon the mighty ocean  
cannot be fathomed by counting;  
that too \[he’ll do\]! Sāriputta’s  
wisdom will have no upper limit. (120) \[259\]

Satisfying[^156] the Sambuddha  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,[^157]  
he’ll attain Wisdom’s Perfection  
and be the topmost disciple. (121) \[260\]

Perfectly he’s going to follow  
the *Dhamma*-wheel which \[will be\] turned  
by the Śākyas’ Son, Neutral One,[^158]  
a *Dhamma*-shower raining forth. (122) \[261\]

Understanding all of that well,  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly  
will place him in the topmost place.” (123) \[262\]

O see the deed[^159] I did so well  
for Teacher Anomadassi.  
Having done what he required[^160]  
in every place I did excel. (124) \[263\]

Karma done immeasurable  
\[aeons hence\] showed me \[its\] fruit here:  
well-liberated, arrow-quick,[^161]  
I have destroyed my defilements. (125) \[264\]

Searching for the unconditioned  
and unshaking state, nirvana,  
sussing out all the heretics  
I circled through existences.[^162] (126) \[265\]

Just as a man, plagued with disease  
would investigate all the jungles  
searching for medicinal herbs  
to be released from his illness, (127) \[266\]

searching for the unconditioned  
state of deathlessness, nirvana,  
without a break[^163] five hundred times  
I went forth into sagely life.[^164] (128) \[267\]

Bearing a weight of matted hair[^165]  
I wore a deer-leather garment;  
perfecting special knowledges  
I went to the world of Brahma. (129) \[268\]

There’s nothing outside the wisdom  
laid down in the Victor’s teaching.[^166]  
Whatever being’s intelligent  
will discern the Victor’s teaching. (130) \[269\]

Then I thought, “this is the method  
for that me, desiring the goal.”  
Searching for the unconditioned  
I wandered the difficult fords. (131) \[270\]

Just as a man, wanting its pith,  
who chops and splits a banana tree  
would not thereby attain that pith  
but would be devoid of that pith, (132) \[271\]

so too the world’s heretics  
with their varied views and big crowds  
lack that which is unconditioned  
like the banana tree lacks pith. (133) \[272\]

When I reached \[my\] last existence  
I was a kinsman of Brahma.[^167]  
Throwing away a whole billion[^168]  
I went forth into homelessness.[^169] (134) \[273\]

The First Recitation Portion.  

There was a learned mantra-knower  
who had mastered the three Vedas,  
a Brahmin known as Sañjaya.  
I dwelt in his vicinity. (135) \[274\]

O Great Hero, your disciple,  
the Brahmin known as Assaji,  
hard to approach, with mighty powers[^170]  
always went about for alms \[there\]. (136) \[275\]

I saw that one who was so wise,  
a sage well used to quietude,  
a peaceful-hearted elephant,  
just like a lotus flower in bloom. (137) \[276\]

Having seen him I realized[^171]  
“this man will be a worthy one,  
well-tamed, whose mind is purified,  
a bull, most excellent, a hero. (138) \[277\]

Pleasing in his mode of conduct,  
beautiful and well-self-controlled,  
tamed in the ultimate taming,  
a seer of deathlessness he’ll be. (139) \[278\]

Why then do I not question him  
the happy one, about the goal?[^172]  
Questioned by me he will reply!”  
Then I am asking \[him\] questions. (140) \[279\]

I proceeded to follow him  
as he wandered about for alms;  
I was honored with permission  
to ask about the deathless state. (141) \[280\]

Approaching him along the road  
I questioned him in this way \[then\]:  
“Of which clan are you, O wise one?  
Whose pupil are you, happy one?[^173] (142) \[281\]

Like a lion which is not frightened  
he, questioned by me, answered thus:  
“A Buddha’s risen in the world;  
I am his student, a follower.” (143) \[282\]

“It would be excellent, wise one,  
o famous one, O \[Buddha’s\] son,  
if you’d please declare to me, sir,[^174]  
the sort of Teaching Buddha teaches.” (144) \[283\]

Questioned by me he \[then\] declared  
the entire deep and subtle state  
in which all suffering’s destroyed  
and craving’s arrow is removed. (145) \[284\]

“The Thus-Gone-One did speak about  
the basic causes of all things  
and the ceasing of those causes;  
that is what the Great Monk declares.” (146) \[285\]

When my question had been answered  
I had attained the first path-fruit.[^175]  
Having heard the Victor’s teaching  
I was free of stain and blemish. (147) \[286\]

After hearing the sage’s speech,  
having seen the superb Teaching,  
well-immersed in that Great Teaching  
I uttered these verses \[aloud\]: (148) \[287\]

“Even if this Teaching goes only this far  
you all should discern \[its\] grief-free state  
as not seen in the past  
performing many sacrifices.[^176] (149) \[288\][^177]

While seeking *Dhamma* \[formerly\]  
I wandered the difficult fords.  
That meaning’s \[now\] obtained by me;  
there is no time for neglecting.” (150) \[289\]

Greatly pleased by \[monk\] Assaji,  
attaining to that tranquil state,  
looking for my co-renouncer  
I returned to the ashram \[then\]. (151) \[290\]

On seeing me from far away  
my companion,[^178] who was well-trained,  
who’d learned[^179] meditative postures,  
\[astonished\], spoke these words \[to me\]: (152) \[291\]

“O sage your face and eyes are pleased  
and you display a sagely mien.  
How have you come to deathlessness,  
everlasting state, nirvana?” (153) \[292\]

You come, conforming to what’s good,  
it is as though you’ve been made calm.  
And you’ve approached \[me\], O Brahmin,  
tamed in the ultimate taming.” (154) \[293\]

“I have attained the deathless state  
where craving’s arrow is destroyed.  
You too ought to attain \[to that\];  
let’s go to the Teacher’s presence.” (155) \[294\]

My companion, who was well-trained,  
assented saying “Excellent!”  
Taking \[his\] hand into \[my\] hand  
we went to the Teacher’s presence. (156) \[295\]

We both of us will now go forth  
in your presence, O Śākyas’ Son.  
Having arrived at your teaching  
we will live without defilements. (157) \[296\]

Kolita’s top in magic powers;  
I’m the one foremost in wisdom.  
The two of us, living as one,  
beautify the dispensation. (158) \[297\]

While my thought was still incomplete  
I wandered the difficult fords.  
Coming to your philosophy  
my thought is now fully mature. (159) \[298\]

Having been planted in the earth,  
trees blossom forth in \[their\] season.  
They exude their heavenly scents  
and delight all living beings. (160) \[299\]

In just this way, O Great Hero,  
o Greatly Famed One, Śākyas’ Son,  
being planted in your teaching  
I want to bear flowers in season. (161) \[300\]

I seek the liberation-flower,  
freedom from this circling rebirth.[^180]  
Finding that liberation-flower  
I’ll delight all living beings. (162) \[301\]

Through this entire Buddha-field  
except for the Great Sage himself,  
in wisdom there is no rival  
for \[me\], your son, O Eyeful One. (163) \[302\]

Well-instructed are your students;  
the retinue is so well-trained.  
Tamed in the ultimate taming  
they always gather around you. (164) \[303\]

Meditators, trance-lovers,  
wise, attentive, with minds at peace,  
sages who have a sagely mien,  
they always gather around you. (165) \[304\]

Wanting little,[^181] clever and wise,  
eating little, with no desires,  
happy if receiving or not,  
they always gather around you. (166) \[305\]

Forest dwellers with wants removed,[^182]  
meditators in shabby robes[^183]  
who delight in being alone,[^184]  
they always gather around you. (167) \[306\]

Attainers of the eight path-fruits  
\[and\] those who are still aspiring,[^185]  
searching for the ultimate goal  
they always gather around you. (168) \[307\]

Stainless enterers of the stream  
and some who are once-returners;  
non-returners and arahants too,  
they always gather around you. (169) \[308\]

Skilled in retaining mindfulness,[^186]  
fond of wisdom’s parts as focus,[^187]  
your followers all, and numerous,  
they always gather around you. (170) \[309\]

Skilled in the magical powers,  
fond of calming-meditation,[^188]  
undertaking fit exertion[^189]  
they always gather around you. (171) \[310\]

Perfected the three knowledges,  
special knowledges, magic powers,  
attaining Wisdom’s Perfection  
they always gather around you. (172) \[311\]

Such indeed are they, Great Hero,  
your students, who are so well-trained,  
hard to approach, with mighty powers,  
they always gather around you. (173) \[312\]

Surrounded by \[all\] those students  
ascetics who have been taught well,  
like a lion which is not frightened  
you shine just like the king of stars.[^190] (174) \[313\]

Having been planted in the earth,  
hardwood trees grow up \[strong and tall\].  
They attain their full abundance  
and \[in season\] display their fruit. (175) \[314\]

O Śākyas’ Son, O Great Famed One,  
you’re analogous to the earth;  
being fixed in your \[great\] teaching,  
they \[like the trees\] grow deathless fruit. (176) \[315\]

The Indus, and the Sarasvatī  
are rivers, like the Candabhāgā,  
the Ganges and the Yamuna  
the Sarabhu and the Mahī too. (177) \[316\]

When those rivers \[finish\] flowing  
the great ocean accepts them \[all\].  
Abandoning their former names,  
they’re all known as “the great ocean”. (178) \[317\]

Likewise these people, of four castes,  
who’ve gone forth into your presence  
abandoning their former names  
are all known as “the Buddha’s sons”. (179) \[318\]

Just as the moon which is unblemished  
going across the space in the sky  
casting its light upon the world  
outshines the entire mass of stars, (180) \[319\]

so likewise you, O Great Hero,  
surrounded by the gods and men,  
going across the Buddha-field  
are shining brightly all the time. (181) \[320\]

Waves which \[first\] arise from the depths  
go no further than the seashore;  
when they do come onto the shore,  
they are crushed to bits[^191] and scattered. (182) \[321\]

Just so the world’s heretics  
with their varied views and big crowds  
wishing to possess the Teaching  
never go further than the Sage. (183) \[322\]

If they \[try\] attaining to that  
through debating, O Eyeful One,  
having come into your presence  
they get thoroughly crushed by you. (184) \[323\]

Just as many white lotuses[^192]  
and *mandālaka* blooms,[^193] water-born,  
do get besmeared by the water  
and also by the mud and clay, (185) \[324\]

so too indeed many creatures  
who’re born and grow up in the world  
are pained by \[their\] lust and anger  
like the white lotus in the mud. (186) \[325\]

Just as a pink lotus,[^194] water-born,  
growing up in the water’s midst  
is not besmeared by the water  
but rather that lotus is clean, (187) \[326\]

so too are you, O Great Hero,  
though born within the world, Great Sage.  
You are not besmeared by the world,  
like the pink lotus by water. (188) \[327\]

Likewise, many lotus flowers  
blossom in the month of April[^195]  
\[but\] do not last beyond that month;  
that is the time for blossoming. (189) \[328\]

So too are you, O Śākyas’ Son  
blooming in your liberation.  
The dispensation’s not surpassed  
like the water-born lotuses. (190) \[329\]

The king of *sal* trees all in bloom  
exudes a heavenly perfume.  
Surrounded by other *sal* trees  
the king of *sal* trees is lovely. (191) \[330\]

So too are you, O Great Hero,  
blooming with a Buddha’s wisdom.  
Circled by the monks’ Assembly,  
like the *sal*-king you are lovely. (192) \[331\]

Just as the Himalayan stone’s  
medicine for living beings  
and the lair of the lesser gods,  
and *nāga*s and *asurās* too, (193) \[332\]

so too are you, O Great Hero,  
medicine[^196] for living beings;  
you’ve mastered the three knowledges,  
special knowledges, great powers. (194) \[333\]

They are admonished, Great Hero,  
by you, \[but\] with \[great\] compassion.  
Delighting in love of *Dhamma*  
they dwell in your dispensation. (195) \[334\]

Likewise a lion, king of beasts,  
going about how he wishes,  
surveying the four directions  
\[then\] growls three times \[his mighty roar\]. (196) \[335\]

All the beasts are very frightened  
because of that lion’s growling.  
Thus just one beast, of noble birth  
always frightens \[all of the rest\]. (197) \[336\]

Because of your growl, Great Hero  
the earth \[herself\] begins to quake.  
Those fit for wisdom realize it,  
scaring the partisans of Death.[^197] (198) \[337\]

The heretics are all afraid  
of your voice, O Sage so Great.  
That flock of crows is in a fluster  
like the beasts with the lion-king.[^198] (199) \[338\]

Those with followers in the world  
are known by the title “Teachers”.  
They teach to their community  
doctrines passed down by tradition. (200) \[339\]

Not so do you, O Great Hero  
preach your Teaching to living beings.  
Understanding the truths yourself[^199]  
\[you preach\] all of Awakening.[^200] (201) \[340\]

Grasping desires and deep fantasies,[^201]  
strengths and weaknesses of senses,[^202]  
discerning who’s able, who’s not,  
you thunder forth like a great cloud. (202) \[341\]

Right to the universe’s edge,  
seated groups of followers are  
thinking through their varied doctrines,  
trying to resolve[^203] \[all\] their[^204] doubts. (203) \[342\]

Reading the minds of everyone,  
skilled in analogies, O Sage,  
discoursing on single questions  
you resolve living beings’ doubts. (204) \[343\]

In this world the earth is filled with  
people like those \[I’ve\] referred to.  
All of them, hands reverently pressed,  
should sing the World-Leader’s praises.[^205] (205) \[344\]

Singing praises for an entire aeon,  
speaking of diverse qualities  
they never could be fully measured;  
the Thus-Gone-One has no measure. (206) \[345\]

Thus singing the Victor’s praises  
with all the power that they have,  
speaking for ten million aeons  
this and that would remain unsaid. (207) \[346\]

If any being, god or man,  
even if he’s \[very\] well-trained  
tries to draw the full \[ocean’s water\][^206]  
he would certainly come to grief.[^207] (208) \[347\]

\[Now\] established in your teaching  
o Śākyas’ Son, O Great Famed One  
having reached Wisdom’s Perfection  
I’m living without defilements. (209) \[348\]

Defeating \[all\] the heretics  
I further the Victor’s teaching.  
Today I’m the *Dhamma*’s general[^208]  
in the teaching[^209] of Śākyas’ Son. (210) \[349\]

Karma done immeasurable  
\[aeons hence\] showed me \[its\] fruit here:  
well-liberated, arrow-quick,[^210]  
I have destroyed my defilements. (211) \[350\]

Whatever man who on his head  
would carry a load, every day,  
he’d be oppressed due to that load,  
\[and\] that burden would be heavy. (212) \[351\]

I transmigrated through lifetimes[^211]  
being burnt up by the three fires,[^212]  
weighed down by the burden of being  
as though I were lifting mountains. (213) \[352\]

My burden \[now\] has been laid down  
and I’ve destroyed[^213] re-becoming.  
I’ve done all things that should be done  
in the Śākyas’ Son’s dispensation. (214) \[353\]

Through this entire Buddha-field  
except the Śākyan Bull himself,  
I’m supreme in terms of wisdom;  
there is no one to rival me. (215) \[354\]

So well-trained in meditation[^214]  
excelling in magical powers,  
today my only desire is to  
create a thousand magically.[^215] (216) \[355\]

Of me who dwelt there by and by  
the Great Sage was the \[great\] Teacher.  
He told me the dispensation;  
cessation[^216] happened lying down. (217) \[356\]

My divine eye is purified  
and I’m skilled in concentration.  
Proper exertion is applied;  
I love wisdom’s parts as focus. (218) \[357\]

Everything is done by me  
which followers ought to attain.  
Except the Leader of the World  
there is no one to rival me. (219) \[358\]

Skilled in the attainments and discipline,  
through altered states I got liberated fast.  
fond of wisdom’s parts as focus  
I’ve excelled in the followers’ virtues. (220) \[359\][^217]

Attaining the followers’ virtues  
I’m honored by the Best of Men.  
\[My\] mind is always filled with faith  
in fellow religious students. (221) \[360\]

Like a snake whose poison’s destroyed,[^218]  
like a bull whose horns are broken,  
freed of my pride and arrogance  
I approach with great reverence.[^219] (222) \[361\]

If my wisdom were a beautiful girl  
she’d hook up with the rulers of earth.  
This is the fruit of \[my\] having praised the  
knowledge of Anomadassi Buddha.[^220] (223) \[362\][^221]

I help keep rolling perfectly  
the *Dhamma*-wheel which was turned  
by the Śākyas’ Son, Neutral One:  
that’s the fruit of praising knowledge. (224) \[363\]

May I not ever, anywhere,  
meet one whose thoughts are less than pure,  
who’s lazy or lacks energy,  
is unlearned or immoral. (225) \[364\]

Let only one who is learned,  
wise, well-fixed in moral precepts  
and settled into mental calm  
come face-to-face in front of me.[^222] (226) \[365\]

I’m saying this to you, O monks,  
gathered together begging here:  
always be happy, with slight wants,  
meditators, trance-lovers. (227) \[366\]

That one whom I saw first of all  
was free of lust and stainless \[too\].  
He’s my teacher, he’s the hero,  
the follower named Assaji. (228) \[367\]

It’s on account of him that I  
today am *Dhamma*’s general.  
In every place, having excelled,  
I’m living without defilements. (229) \[368\]

I bow my head in reverence  
to whatever region he’s in,  
that one who was my own teacher  
the follower named Assaji. (230) \[369\]

Having called to mind my karma  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly  
placed \[me\] in the foremost place \[then\]. (231) \[370\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,[^223]  
I am living without constraint.[^224] \[371\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing[^225] for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[372\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (232) \[373\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sāriputta Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sāriputta Thera is finished.

[^83]: *acchaº,* Sinh. gloss *valassu*

[^84]: *koka*, etymological cousin of *vāka*, *vṛka*, above, see RD

[^85]: *taracchā*, Sinh. gloss *kara bānā* (‘submissive” “bent over”) *valassu,* Note BJTS omits the second mention of “wolves” so may be taking *koka* in compound with *taracchā* (i.e., *kokataracchā*), in specifying this particular type of bear (cf. Sorata, *kara baāna valasā,* s.v.)

[^86]: i.e., showing their rut in their eyes, ears, and genitals. See cty, p. 288.

[^87]: I.e., elephant. Cty (p. 311; 288): born in the *mātaṅga* clan of elephants

[^89]: *vānarā,* Sinh. gloss *vandurō*

[^90]: *vanakammikā*

[^91]: *cetā*, Sinh. gloss *dāsayō* (“slaves”) seems to read *ceta as ceṭa, ceṭaka,* servant, boy; I follow the gloss in giving the word (otherwise “mind,” “thought”) a translation, though RD and PSI dict give no indication that *ceta* is an alternate spelling for *ceṭa*

[^92]: *luddakā*, Sinh. gloss *väddō,* aborigines of Sri Lanka (Veddas)

[^108]: BJTS reads *aluva.* RD: fr. Skt. *ālu, āluka*: a bulbous plant, Radix Globosa Esculenta or Amorphophallus (Kern), Arum Campanulatum (Hardy), cognate with alium, good possibility is amorphophallus titanum, “titan arum”

[^109]: BJTS reads *biḷālīº*

[^110]: BJTS reads *sutaka*

[^111]: RD says this is a water-plant, a kind of lotus, referencing J iv.539; vi.47, 279, 564. Here BJTS Sinh. gloss is *taḍāgayangen*, “from the moss,” following its reading of \[170\] “well fixed \[in the mosses\]”. Bot. Dict. *taḍāga* = *sevela.* At \[4231\], \[4233\], \[4313\], \[6332\] the (or a) BJTS gloss is *helmällen, heḷmäli* = edible white water-lily, Nymphaea Lotus. At \[4007\] BJTS glosses it as *madāra* tree \[mountain-ebony, Bauhinia purpurea (*Legum.*)\] and says the blossoms fell into the water from overhanging trees. BJTS gloss at \[324\] is “a water-born plant named *Mandālā”.*

[^112]: Reading *balapatto* with BJTS for PTS *phalapatto* (“obtaining results”)

[^113]: While arahants have six special knowledges, only the first five (psychic power over matter, clairaudience, clairvoyance, recollection of one’s own former births, knowledge of others’ rebirth) are possible for non-Buddhist sages; the sixth is certainty of one’s own nirvana.

[^114]: Lit., “attained excellence in”

[^115]: Lit., “delighting in their paternal pastures” (*pettike gocare ratā*), which cty understands in terms of the food they received.

[^116]: *Asaṃsaṭṭha*, lit., “not joined,” “unmixed”. I follow the cty in this translation.

[^117]: Lit., “my students were difficult to approach”

[^118]: This follows the cty -- “having gone they bring the fruit from a jambu a hundred yojanas off in the Himalayas.”

[^126]: *kumbhaṇḍā*

[^127]: *dānavā*

[^128]: That is, ascetics, who carry around all their possessions, limited to the basic necessities they require, in shoulder yokes. Cty: *khāribhāran ti : udañcanakamaṆḍalu-ādikam tāpasaparikkharabhāram*.

[^129]: Reading *khipita* (BJTS, some PTS alt) for *khitta*, witness some alternate readings in PTS Apadāna, also the reading of BJTS, Hew. Khitta = thrown down, hard to see how it fits here.

[^130]: *pāde pādam nikkhipantā* = placing the foot on the foot. Do I have the right sense of this, i.e., that it is about careful, controlled steps?

[^131]: Lit., “constantly am receiving joy”, or “receiving laughter” or “smiles”. How about, “I constantly receive their smiles”?

[^132]: reading *vipaccatan* (BJTS) for *paccatan* (PTS).

[^133]: lit arising out of *samādhi*

[^134]: lit I am carrying, bearing

[^142]: *Disaṃ olokayī,* lit., “looked out in the directions”

[^144]: lit., “recognizing \[that there would be\] speech of the Buddha”

[^145]: *Saddhamma*

[^146]: *turiya*, musical instruments

[^147]: *bheri*

[^148]: hasulā = ?xxx Cf. RD *hasula*, s.v., which following Kern treats this as a corrupted reading of *bhamuka*, “eyebrows” or “thick eyebrows”, often found in combination with the term for “long eyelashes” (*aḷārapamha*).

[^149]: RD gives “good hips,” referring to this text. I don’t see the warrant, and take the term *susaññā* from *saññā*, sense, perception, as does BJTS

[^150]: lit., 80 *koṭis* = 80 x 10,000,000 or 800,000,000 \[pieces of money\]

[^151]: *Pabbajissati ‘kiñcano*

[^152]: *Oraso dhammanimmito*

[^153]: This is the BJTS spelling; PTS gives *Bhāgīrasī*

[^154]: Lit., “going to”.

[^155]: *tappayissati &lt;tappetu*

[^156]: *ārādhayitvā* = satisfied, pleased, accomplished

[^157]: or °chief: *Śākyapungavaṃ*

[^158]: *tādinā* = *tādi*, an arahant who is “such” in matters both disagreeable and agreeable. He takes things as they are, thus I sometimes translate the term ”Such-Like” or “Such-Like One” as well as “Neutral One”.

[^159]: *kāraŋ*

[^160]: *Kāram katvā*

[^161]: or perhaps “I’m released, quick like an arrow;”

[^162]: *Saṃsārim bhave*

[^163]: *Avokiṇṇam/avyākiṇṇam* (cty = *avichinnaṃ, nirantaraṃ*)

[^164]: *Pabbajjim isipabbajjaṃ*

[^165]: *jaṭābhārabharito* (PTS), *jaṭābhārena bharito* (BJTS)

[^166]: *Jinasāsanaṃ*

[^167]: *Brahmabandhu*, i.e., a Brahmin

[^168]: 100 *koṭis* = 100 x 10,000,000 = 1,000,000,000. Cf. v. \[251\], above: Sāriputta was even richer than Anomadassi Buddha predicted he would be.

[^169]: *Pabbajim anāgāriyaṃ*.

[^170]: *Ugga-tejo* = “possessing mighty (fierce, hot) *tejas* (power, heat)”

[^171]: *Me cittam uppajj;* lit., “my mind arose,” “my idea was born”.

[^172]: Lit., “about the ultimate goal”.

[^173]: PTS reads *marisa,* not in the dictionaries, not glossed in the cty. BJTS read *mārisa*, hence this translation. Usually used of those in heaven. In the vocative, paralleling “*dhira*”.

[^174]: *āvuso,* BJTS glosses *nidukānan vahansa* (“you \[respectful\] without suffering”)

[^175]: *Paṭhamaṃ phalam-ajjhagaṃ,* i.e., became a Sotāpanna or Stream-enterer, a person who will achieve nirvana after seven more births, and will not in the meantime fall into any bad birth-states. This interpretation follows the BJTS SInhala gloss. Another plausible reading, which would make better sense of the accusative form of *paṭhama* (otherwise, why not *paṭhamaphalam-ajjhagaṃ*?), is “first, I attained the fruit”

[^176]: *bahukehi kappana-hutehi. *

[^177]: PTS and BJTS both read the verse in a meter unlike the XXX of the opening verses and the (sloka? gatha?) that characterizes the bulk of *Apadāna.* Those exhibit a consistent 11-11-11-11 or 8-8-8-8, respectively, number of syllables per foot. The present verse seems to be 11-9-6-9 (like the XXX, get the proper terms in Pali from Warder’s Pali Meter \[if it is a metre?\]), and I have translated accordingly.

[^178]: = Kolita, Mahāmoggallāna.

[^179]: Lit., “who was endowed with” or “to whom there was much”

[^180]: *Bhavasamsāramocanaṃ*

[^182]: *dhuta-ratā*

[^183]: *lūkha-civarā*

[^184]: *viveka*, seclusion, detachment, meditation, being apart, loneliness

[^185]: See cty p. 233. *Paṭipanna* = attained four fruits of the path, in the eighth fruit (*phalaṭṭh*ā) established arahantship; *sekhā-phala* = the lower (or as John Strong \[1983\]: would have it, slower) three fruits (*sotāpanna, sakadāgami, anāgami*)

[^186]: *Satipaṭṭhānakusalā*

[^187]: *Bojjhangā-bhāvanā-ratā,* lit., “fond of meditating on the constituents of wisdom.” The constituents of wisdom are usually enumerated as seven: mindfulness, investigation of the law, energy, rapture, repose, concentration and equanimity.

[^188]: *Samādhi-bhāvanā-ratā.*

[^189]: *Sammappadhānam anuyuktā.*

[^190]: The moon.

[^191]: *sañcuṇṇā *

[^192]: *kumuda*

[^193]: RD says this is a water-plant, a kind of lotus, referencing J iv.539; vi.47, 279, 564. Here BJTS gloss is “a water-born plant named *Mandālā”.* At \[171\] BJTS Sinh. gloss is *taḍāgayangen*, “from the moss,” following its reading of \[170\] “well fixed \[in the mosses\]”. Bot. Dict. *taḍāga* = *sevela.* At \[4231\], \[4233\], \[4313\], \[6332\] the (or a) BJTS gloss is *helmällen, heḷmäli* = edible white water-lily, Nymphaea Lotus. At \[4007\] BJTS glosses it as *madāra* tree \[mountain-ebony, Bauhinia purpurea (*Legum.*)\] and says the blossoms fell into the water from overhanging trees.

[^194]: *paduma*

[^195]: actually March-April, *Bak Māsa* in the Sinhala calendar, *rammaka māsa* in Pali

[^196]: lit., “like medicine”

[^197]: *māra-kāyikā* -- those in Mara’s troupe.

[^198]: lit., “with the king of beasts”.

[^199]: reading *sāmaṃ* (BJTS) for *samaŋ* (PTS).

[^200]: lit., “the complete party of Awakening” (here reading *pakkhiyaṃ* \[BJTS\] for *pakkhikaŋ* \[PTS\]).

[^201]: *āsaya* = likes, wants + *anusaya* = defilements deep in the mind which have not been acted upon

[^202]: reading *balābalaṃ* (BJTS, cty) for *phalāphalaŋ* (“the fruits and the fruitlessness,” PTS).

[^203]: lit., “for the sake of resolving”

[^204]: taking *taṃ* as *tesaṃ*, with the cty

[^205]: here I follow the cty, which glosses *kittayun* as *gunaṃ katheyyuṃ.*

[^206]: I follow the cty here.

[^207]: Lit., “he would receive nothing but destruction”

[^208]: *Dhamma-senāpati,* lit., “the chief of the army of *Dhamma*,” or perhaps “*Dhamma’s* commander in chief.” Pronounce as “gen’ral” to keep the meter when chanting.

[^209]: “Army” would make the analogy work better

[^210]: or perhaps “I’m released, quick like an arrow;”

[^211]: lit., “existences”

[^212]: the cty here explains these as the fires of *rāga* (lust), *dosa* (anger) and *moha* (ignorance, folly)

[^213]: cty glosses *ugghāṭitā* as *viddhaṃsitā.*

[^214]: *samādhimhi.*

[^215]: reading *sahassam* (BJTS, PTS alt) for *sahāyam* (“friend,” “companion,” PTS). BJTS Sinhala gloss understands this to mean creating a thousand forms by means of *iddh*\i -- the self-multiplication miracle found throughout these texts.

[^216]: lit., “my cessation”.

[^217]: this verse is in a different (larger XXX) meter, apparently 10-11-7-10, so I translate accordingly.

[^218]: reading *uddhaṭa* (BJTS, cty) for *uddhata* (PTS).

[^219]: lit., “I approach the group with great reverence.”

[^220]: lit., “Blessed One”.

[^221]: here too a more elaborate meter, 10-9-10-10. XXX

[^222]: Lit., “stand on/before my head.”

[^223]: Lit., “like an elephant having broken \[its\] chains.” I take some poetic license and adopt the plural in order to make the phrase work metrically, here and in all subsequent instances of this verse, which recurs quite regularly throughout the *Apadāna.*

[^224]: *vhārāmi anāsavo,* lit., “I am dwelling without outflows;” *āsavas* are “constraints” to the achievement of nirvana.

[^225]: Lt. “was well come to me”
