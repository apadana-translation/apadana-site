*\[168. Dussadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
In lovely Tivarā City,  
I was the son of the king then.  
After having received a gift,[^2]  
I gave it to the Calm \[Buddha\]. (1) \[2087\]  
The Blessed One accepted \[it\];  
he touched the cloth with \[both his\] hands.  
After accepting, Siddhattha  
then rose up in the air, the sky. (2) \[2088\]  
When the Buddha was going \[away,\]  
that cloth flew off behind \[him then\].  
I brought pleasure to \[my\] heart there:  
‘the Buddha is the Top Person.” (3) \[2089\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave that cloth \[to him\] back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving cloth. (4) \[2090\]  
In the sixty-seventh aeon  
there was a wheel-turning monarch,  
a lord of people with great strength,  
known by the name Parisuddha.[^3] (5) \[2091\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2092\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Dussadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Dussadāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Cloth-Donor”  
[^2]: one would prefer *paṇṇakāra* to *paṇṇākāra,* but both PTS and BJTS
    give the latter spelling. Still, I treat the term as the former; so
    does the BJTS Sinhala gloss (*paṇḍurak koṭa dun vastrayak*). The cty
    glosses the term as *vattha*, a cloth.  
[^3]: “Very Pure”
