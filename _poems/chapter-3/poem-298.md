### \[298. Saraṇagamaniya[^1]\]

On a Himalayan mountain,  
I was a hunter at that time.  
I saw the Buddha, Vipassi,  
the World’s Best, the Bull of Men. (1) \[2706\]

Attending on the Sambuddha  
I did what’s proper for elders,  
and \[then\] I went to the Biped Lord,  
the Neutral \[Buddha,\] for refuge. (2) \[2707\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I went for refuge \[at that time\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of going for refuge. (3) \[2708\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2709\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saraṇagamaniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Saraṇagamaniya Thera is finished.
