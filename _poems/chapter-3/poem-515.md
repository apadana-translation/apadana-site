*\[512. {515.}*[^1] *Nāgapupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
I gave an ironwood[^3] flower  
to the Gold-Colored Sambuddha,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
who had entered onto the road. (1) \[5479\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that flower back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (2) \[5480\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[5481\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[5482\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5483\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Nāgapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Nāgapupphiya Thera is finished.
