*\[350. {353.}*[^1] *Kiŋsukapūjaka*[^2]*\]*  
Seeing a pulas tree in bloom,[^3]  
stretching out hands pressed together,  
recalling Siddhattha Buddha,  
I offered *pūjā* in the sky. (1) \[3150\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (2) \[3151\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3152\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kiŋsukapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kiŋsukapūjaka Thera is finished.
