*\[129. Gandhapupphiya*[^1]*\]*

The Golden-Colored Sambuddha

Vipassi, Worthy of Respect,

Honored by \[all his\] followers,[^2]

set out from the monastery. (1) \[1856\]

Having seen the Best of Buddhas

the Omniscient One, Undefiled,

I did scented-flower-*pūjā,*

happy, \[and\] with a happy heart. (2) \[1857\]

Due to that pleasure in \[my\] heart

for the Biped-Lord, Neutral One,

again I worshipped the Thus-Gone-One,

happy, \[and\] with a happy heart. (3) \[1858\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I offered that flower \[to him\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[1859\]

In the forty-first aeon hence

the kṣatriyan named Varaṇa[^3]

was a wheel-turner with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[1860\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1861\]

Thus indeed Venerable Gandhapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Gandhapupphiya Thera is finished.

    cty reading of the name; PTS gives Gaṇṭhipupphiya,
    “Knot/Joint-Flowers”.

[^2]: *purakkhato sāvakehi,* lit.,”Honored by \[His\] Followers” “Placed
    in Front by \[His\] Followers”

[^3]: according to RD, the name of a tree, Crataeva roxburghii, but he
    also points to Skt. *varaṇa,* “Causeway” “Rampart” “Wall”
