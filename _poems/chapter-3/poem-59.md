*\[59. Paduma*[^1]*\]*  
He was declaring the Four Truths  
\[while\] turning the best *Dhamma*-wheel,  
raining the rain of deathlessness,  
liberating many people.[^2] (1) \[1323\]

Taking a lotus with a flag,[^3]  
standing half a *kosa*[^4] \[away\],  
happy, I raised it in the air  
for the Sage Padumuttara. (2) \[1324\]

There was a strange occurrence then:  
the lotus approached \[the Buddha\].  
Discerning what I was thinking  
the Best Debater \[then\] took \[it\]. (3) \[1325\]

Having taken with his fine hand  
\[that\] superb water-born lotus,  
standing in the monks’ Assembly  
the Teacher spoke these verses \[then\]: (4) \[1326\]

“I shall relate details of him  
who \[just\] tossed this lotus flower  
to the Omniscient Arahant;[^5]  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (5) \[1327\]

Thirty aeons as king of gods  
he will exercise divine rule.  
With seven hundred earthly reigns  
he will reside upon the earth. (6) \[1328\]

Taking a bowl \[of lotuses\][^6] there,  
he’ll be a king who turns the wheel.  
A rain of flowers from the sky  
will rain \[on him\] all of the time. (7) \[1329\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (8) \[1330\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (9) \[1331\]

Coming forth from \[my mother’s\] womb,  
\[both\] comprehending \[and\] mindful,  
when I was \[only\] five years old[^7]  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (10) \[1332\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[1333\]

Thus indeed Venerable Paduma Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Paduma Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Pink Lotus”

[^2]: lit., “making many people achieve nirvana.” I am tempted to use a
    neologism like “nirvan-izing” to get the verbal usage of
    *nibbāpento*, but refrain.

[^3]: BJTS and some PTS alternatives read *sadaṇḍaṃ* (“with the stem”)
    for *sadhajaŋ*, but as cty agrees with PTS in reading *sadhajaŋ* I
    translate “with a flag” despite the evocative appeal of “with the
    stem.”

[^4]: a *kosa* is 500 bow lengths, so he would have been standing 250
    bow lengths away.

[^5]: lit., “One Without Outflows,” “Undefiled One,” i.e., the Buddha

[^6]: this follows the BJTS Sinhala gloss. Cty offers no comment. Could
    *pattaŋ gahetvā* also be, “taking appointment”?

[^7]: lit., “being five years from birth”
