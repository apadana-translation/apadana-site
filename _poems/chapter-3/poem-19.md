*\[19. Sopāka\]*  
The Blessed One named Siddhattha  
came into my presence \[one time\]  
when I was cleaning[^1] a retreat[^2]  
on a most fine,[^3] superb mountain. (1) \[784\]  
Seeing the Buddha who’d arrived  
I spread out a woven \[grass\] mat  
for the World’s Best, the Neutral One,  
and gave \[to him\] that floral seat. (2) \[785\]  
Sitting on that seat of flowers  
Siddhattha the World-Leader  
discerning my situation  
\[then\] spoke about impermanence. (3) \[786\]  
“In flux indeed is all that is;  
things that arise and \[then\] decline  
are being born \[and then\] dying;  
happy is the relief from them.” (4) \[787\]  
Saying this the Omniscient One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
the Hero[^4] flew into the sky  
just like a swan-king in the air. (5) \[788\]  
Abandoning my own dogma  
I \[then\] perceived impermanence.  
Meditating for \[just\] one \[day\],  
\[right then and\] there I passed away. (6) \[789\]  
Incited by \[my\] wholesome roots  
I \[then\] enjoyed the two-fold bliss.[^5]  
When \[my\] last rebirth was attained  
I was born among dog-cookers.[^6](7) \[790\]  
After I set out from the house  
I went forth into homelessness.  
Dread-locked ascetic seven years,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (8) \[791\]  
Energetic,[^7] self-abandoned,  
careful about the moral rules,  
having pleased the Great Elephant  
I got higher ordination. (9) \[792\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that’s the fruit of a flower-gift. (10 \[793\]  
In the ninety-fourth aeon since  
I obtained that perception \[then\],  
meditating upon that sense  
my defilements were \[all\] destroyed. (11) \[794\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[795\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Sopāka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Venerable Sopāka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: BJTS and cty read *sevantassa* (“serving”) for *sodhayantassa*
    (“washing” “making clean”); either term conveys the meaning,
    elaborated by the cty, that he was a worker at the retreat.  
[^2]: *pabbhara* is a slope, incline; cty explains that it was a place
    on the mountain where the monks would relax or be separated from
    others (*vivekaṭṭhānaṃ,,* “leisure spot”)  
[^3]: PTS gives *pavare,* “most excellent;” BJTS reads *vipine*,
    “forest\[ed\]” (or “in the forest”).  
[^4]: BJTS (and PTS alt.) reads *dhīro* (“the wise one”)  
[^5]: *dve sampatti*. See above, n. to \[702\].  
[^6]: i.e., despicable, low people. Lit, “I approached a dog-cooker’s
    womb.” On the semantic range and history of this insulting term, see
    David White, “Dogs Die.”  
[^7]: lit., “with strenuous effort”
