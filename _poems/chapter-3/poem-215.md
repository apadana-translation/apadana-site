### \[215. Raŋsisaññaka[^1]\]

\[I saw\] the superb Tiger-Bull,  
Well-Born-One, on a mountainside,  
like the rising hundred-rayed \[sun\],  
like the sun \[when its\] rays are cool.[^2] (1) \[2339\]

The majesty of the Buddha  
was shining on the mountainside.  
\[My\] heart pleased in the rays; for an  
aeon I sported in heaven. (2) \[2340\]

In \[all\] the subsequent[^3] aeons,  
goodness[^4] was completed by me  
because of that mental pleasure,  
and remembering the Buddha. (3) \[2341\]

In the thirty thousand aeons  
since I obtained that perception,[^5]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of Buddha-perception. (4) \[2342\]

In the fifty-seventh aeon  
there was one lord of the people,  
known by the name of Sujāta,[^6]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (5) \[2343\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2344\]

Thus indeed Venerable Raŋsisaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Raŋsisaññaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Ray-Perceiver”

[^2]: *vītaraṃsi*/*vītaraṃsa*. RD says the metaphor is much attested, but unclear. I take it to refer to sunny days that are not oppressively hot, whether due to light cover, the time of day, or the time of year.

[^3]: lit., remaining, additional

[^4]: *kusalaŋ*

[^5]: lit., “since I obtained that perception at that time.” I have omitted the *tadā* to keep the meter.

[^6]: “Well-Born”
