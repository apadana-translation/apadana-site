### \[449. {452.}[^1] Morahatthiya[^2]\]

Collecting \[some\] peacock feathers,  
I \[then\] approached the World-Leader.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I gave \[him those\] peacock feathers. (1) \[4805\]

Through those[^3] peacock feathers, \[given\]  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
the three fires[^4] are blown out in me;  
I’m receiving huge happiness. (2) \[4806\]

O! the Buddha! O! the Teaching!  
O! our Teacher’s \[great\] achievement!  
Having given peacock feathers,  
I’m receiving huge happiness. (3) \[4807\]

The three fires[^5] are blown out in me;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed;  
all the defilements are exhausted,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled. (4) \[4808\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that donation then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of peacock feathers. (5) \[4809\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (6) \[4810\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4811\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[4812\]

Thus indeed Venerable Morahatthiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Morahatthiya Thera is finished.
