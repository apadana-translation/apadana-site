### \[453. {456.}[^1] Vanakoraṇḍiya[^2]\]

Taking wild *koraṇḍa* \[flowers,\][^3]  
I offered \[them\] to the Buddha  
\[named\] Siddhattha, the Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One. (1) \[4828\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I offered \[him\] that flower \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (2) \[4829\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4830\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4831\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4832\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vanakoraṇḍiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Vanakoraṇḍiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Wild *Koraṇḍa*-er”

[^3]: *vanakoraṇḍam*, presumably a wild-growing (lit., “forest”) variety of *koraṇḍa*, Sinh. *kaṭukoraṇḍu*, Barberia prionitis (*Acanth.*), cf. *koraṇḍaka*, *kuraṇḍaka*, a shrub and its flower, J. v.473 (RD); here BJTS gloss is *vanakaraṇḍa*, which I do not find in the dictionaries (a different species from *kaṭukoraṇḍa*?)
