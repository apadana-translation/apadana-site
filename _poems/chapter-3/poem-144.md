### \[144. Saparivāriya[^1]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
like a blazing column of fire,  
the Sambuddha \[then\] passed away.[^2] (1) \[1955\]

When the Great Hero passed away,[^3]  
a stupa was piled up[^4] \[there then\].  
Day and night[^5] they attended on  
the ultimate best relic-womb. (2) \[1956\]

With a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind  
I made a sandalwood railing,  
and giving mounds of incense \[too,\]  
the stupa was then suitable. (3) \[1957\]

Transmigrating in existence,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
I saw no inferior state:  
that’s the fruit of former karma. (4) \[1958\]

In the fifteen-hundredth aeon  
ago, there were eight people.  
All of them were named Samatta,[^6]  
wheel-turning kings with great power. (5) \[1959\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1960\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saparivāriya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Saparivāriya Thera is finished.
