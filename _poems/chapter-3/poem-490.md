*\[487. {490.}*[^1] *Sālamaṇḍapiya*[^2]*\]*  
Plunged into a *sal* \[tree\] forest,  
I had a well-made hermitage,  
which was covered with *sal* flowers;  
I live in the woods at that time. (1) \[5219\]

The Blessed One, Piyadassi,  
Self-Become One, the Chief Person,  
Seclusion-Lover, Sambuddha,  
came into the *sal-*forest then. (2) \[5220\]

Departing from the hermitage,  
I went into the forest \[then\].  
Searching for roots and fruit \[to eat\],  
I’m roaming in the forest then. (3) \[5221\]

There I saw \[him\], the Sambuddha,  
Piyadassi, Greatly Famed One,  
well-seated, attaining \[the goal\],  
shining \[light\] in the great forest. (4) \[5222\]

Having placed four sticks of wood \[there\],  
building a well-made pavilion  
above the Buddha \[at that time,\]  
I covered \[it\] with *sal* flowers. (5) \[5223\]

For seven days I held up \[that\]  
*sal*-flower-covered pavilion.  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart there,  
I worshipped \[him\], the Best Buddha. (6) \[5224\]

At that time the Blessed One \[then\]  
rose up from \[his\] meditation.[^3]  
Looking but a plough’s length ahead,[^4]  
the Ultimate Person sat down. (7) \[5225\]

Named Varuṇa, the follower  
of Piyadassi, the Teacher,  
with one hundred thousand masters,[^5]  
then approached the Guide, \[the Buddha\]. (8) \[5226\]

Piyadassi, the Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly,  
the Victor then displayed a smile.[^6] (9) \[5227\]

Anuruddha, the attendant,  
of Piyadassi, the Teacher,  
placed his robe on one shoulder,  
\[then\] asked \[this\] of \[him\], the Great Sage: (10) \[5228\]

“What is the cause, O Blessed One,  
of the smiling of the Teacher?  
When what reason was being known  
did you display that, O Teacher?” (11) \[5229\]

“This young man who held for me a  
floral canopy for a week:  
having remembered his karma,  
I displayed \[that\] smile \[at that time\]. (12) \[5230\]

“I do not see \[sufficient\] space  
for that good karma[^7] to ripen.  
In the world of gods or men  
there is not \[found\] sufficient space. (13) \[5231\]

When \[this\] good-karma[^8] possessor  
is living in the world of gods,  
as far as his \[whole\] retinue,  
there will be a *sal* canopy. (14) \[5232\]

As befits \[this one’s\] good karma,[^9]  
being \[there\] he’ll be delighted  
by dances which are \[all\] divine,  
and by songs \[and\] speeches \[as well\]. (15) \[5233\]

As far as his \[whole\] retinue,  
there will be many[^10] \[fine\] perfumes,  
and a rain \[made of\] *sal* flowers  
will be raining all the time \[there\]. (16) \[5234\]

When this man has fallen from there,  
he will go to the human state.  
Here too a floral canopy  
will be carried all of the time. (17) \[5235\]

And here \[too\] dance as well as song,  
well-accompanied by cymbals,[^11]  
will attend on him constantly:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (18) \[5236\]

Also, when the sun is rising,  
a downpour of *sal* will rain forth.  
Connected with \[his\] good karma,[^12]  
\[that rain\] will rain all of the time. (19) \[5237\]

\[After\] eighteen hundred aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (20) \[5238\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled. (21) \[5239\]

There will be a *sal* canopy  
for this one who grasps the Teaching,  
\[and\] that \[*sal*\] canopy will be there  
for him being burnt on a pyre. (22) \[5240\]

Detailing the result \[for me\],  
Piyadassi \[Buddha\], Great Sage,  
preached Dharma to \[my\] retinue,  
refreshing \[them\] with Dharma-rain. (23) \[5241\]

For thirty aeons among the  
gods, I exercised divine rule,  
and sixty plus four times I was  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (24) \[5242\]

Coming here from the world of gods,  
I’m receiving huge happiness.  
Here too \[there’s\] a *sal* canopy:  
that’s the fruit of a canopy.[^13] (25) \[5243\]

This is the final time for me;  
\[my\] last rebirth is proceeding.[^14]  
Even here a *sal* canopy  
exists \[for me\] all of the time. (26)[^15]  
Having pleased \[him\], the Sage So Great,  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state,  
beyond \[all\] conquest and defeat. (27) \[5244\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I worshipped[^16] the Buddha \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (28) \[5245\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (29) \[5246\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (30) \[5247\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (31) \[5248\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sālamaṇḍapiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sālamaṇḍapiya Thera is finished.  
The Summary:  
Naḷamālī, Maṇidada,  
Ukkāsatika, Vījanī,  
Kummāsa and Kusaṭṭha \[too\],  
also Giripunnāgiya,  
Vallikāra,[^17] Pānadhida  
\[and\] then Pulīnacaṅkama:  
five and ninety are the verses  
that are counted by those who know.
