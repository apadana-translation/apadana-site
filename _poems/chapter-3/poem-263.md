*\[263. Aḍḍhacandiya*[^1]*\]*

A half-moon[^2] was given by me

at the tree[^3] rising up from earth,

at the feet of Blessed Tissa’s

Bodhi, \[a crocodile-bark tree\].[^4] (1) \[2549\]

In the ninety-two aeons since

I offered that flower \[to it\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Bodhi-*pūjā*. (2) \[2550\]

In the twenty-fifth aeon hence

a kṣatriyan named Devapa[^5]

was a wheel-turner with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2551\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2552\]

Thus indeed Venerable Aḍḍhacandiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Aḍḍhacandiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Half-Moon-er”

[^2]: the cty takes the term to be the name of a flower, which seems
    likely given the reference to “that flower” (or “those flowers”) in
    v. 2 \[2550\]

[^3]: the term for “tree” used here, *pādape,* lit., means
    “foot-drinker” and resonates/puns with the superb “feet” of the tree
    where he gives the “half-moon” (flowers?).

[^4]: the Bodhi Tree of Tissa Buddha was *asana*, Pentaptera tomentosa,
    aka crocodile-bark tree, black murdah, Indian laurel, silver
    greywood, white chuglam.

[^5]: I am unclear about the meaning of this name; could be read as *de*
    + *vapa* (“Two Sowings” or “Twice Sheared”), or *deva-pā*,
    (“Drinking \[like?\] a God /King”)”
