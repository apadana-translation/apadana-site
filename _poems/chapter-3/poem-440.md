*\[437. {440.}*[^1] *Jambuphaliya*[^2]*\]*  
When Padumuttara Buddha,  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One,  
was wandering about for alms,  
maintaining superlative fame, (1) \[4710\]  
taking the best \[rose-apple\][^3] fruit,  
with a mind that was very clear,  
I gave \[it\] to the Teacher, the  
Hero, the One Deserving Gifts. (2) \[4711\]  
O Biped-Lord,[^4] O World’s Best One,  
Bull of Men, due to that karma,  
I’ve attained the unshaking place  
beyond \[all\] conquest and defeat. (3) \[4712\]  
In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave that donation then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving the best. (4) \[4713\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[4714\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4715\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4716\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Jambuphaliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Jambuphaliya Thera is finished.  
The Summary:  
Ekavihārī Thera and  
Saṅkhika, Pāṭihīraka,  
Thavika and Ucchukaṇḍī[^5]  
Kalamb’, Ambāṭakapadā,[^6]  
Harīṭak’, and Ambapiṇḍī,  
Jambuda goes as the tenth \[poem\].  
There are eighty-six verses \[here\],  
which are counted by those who know.  
The Ekavihāriya Chapter, the Forty-Fourth  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Rose-apple-Fruit-er.” Virtually the same *apadāna* is repeated
    below as \#{552} (BJTS only), ascribed to Nadīkassapa Thera. Lacking
    the name “Rose-apple Fruit-er” there it leaves the type of fruit
    donated ambiguous, as does the Pāḷi  
[^3]: *jambu.* BJTS Sinhala gloss suggests this interpolation,
    presumably based on the name of the protagonist (which appears in
    the colophon), but the Pāli of the poem itself does not specify what
    *kind* of fruit this one was the best of.  
[^4]: I read this and the following two epithets in the vocative, in
    keeping with PTS, though BJTS reads them as nominatives, continuing
    the preceding verse, here and in the repeated version (\#{552}). See
    the latter for the treatment of them as nominatives.  
[^5]: BJTS reads *Ucchukhaṇḍi*  
[^6]: BJTS reads *Ambāṭakappadā*
