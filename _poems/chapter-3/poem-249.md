*\[249. Bimbijāliya*[^1]*\]*

The Victor Padumuttara,

Self-Become One, the Chief Person,

explaining the Four \[Noble\] Truths,

declared the path to deathlessness. (1) \[2491\]

At that time I \[then\] spread out \[there\]

flowers \[called\] *bimbijālika*[^2]

\[and\] offered \[them\] to the Buddha,

Lord of Bipeds, the Neutral One. (2) \[2492\]

In the sixty-eighth aeon hence

were four \[named\] Kiñjakesara,[^3]

wheel-turning monarchs with great strength,

possessors of the seven gems. (3) \[2493\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2494\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bimbijāliya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bimbijāliya Thera is finished.
