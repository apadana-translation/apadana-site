## Timirapupphiya Chapter, the Seventh

### \[81. Timirapupphiya[^1]\]

On <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andabhāgā River’s bank  
I was going along the stream  
\[when\] I saw the Monk sitting \[there,\]  
the Brilliant One, the Unperturbed. (1) \[1497\]

Having pleased \[my\] heart about him  
I thought in this way at that time:  
“This Crossed One will make \[others\] cross;  
this Tame One will tame \[others too\]. (2) \[1498\]

The Comforted One will console;  
the Calmed One will make \[others\] calm;  
the Freed One will set \[others\] free;  
the Quenched One[^2] will quench \[others too\].” (3) \[1499\]

After reflecting in this way  
\[then\] picking up a dark flower  
I laid it on top of the head  
of Siddhattha the Sage so Great. (4) \[1500\]

Pressing both my hands together  
\[and\] circumambulating \[him\],  
having worshipped the Teacher’s feet  
I departed \[there\] toward the west. (5) \[1501\]

A short time into \[my\] journey  
a lion was \[then\] stalking[^3] me.  
Going along a precipice,  
right there I fell down \[and I died\]. (6) \[1502\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I offered that flower \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (7) \[1503\]

In the fifty-sixth aeon hence  
there were seven \[men\], greatly famed,  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (8) \[1504\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1505\]

Thus indeed Venerable Timirapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Timirapupphiya Thera is finished.
