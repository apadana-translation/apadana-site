### \[464. {467.}[^1] Labujadāyaka[^2]\]

In the city, Bandhumatī,  
I worked in a hermitage then.[^3]  
I saw the Spotless One, Buddha,  
\[who\] was traveling through the sky. (1) \[4895\]

Taking fruit of a breadfruit[^4] \[tree,\]  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha.  
Standing in the sky, the Calm One,  
the Great Famed One accepted \[it\].  
With a mind that was very clear,  
having given Buddha that fruit,  
productive of delight for me,  
bringing happiness in this world,  
I then came to possess great joy  
and vast, ultimate happiness.  
A gem was truly produced for  
\[me,\] being reborn here and there.[^5] (2-3) \[4896-4898\][^6]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[the Buddha\] fruit back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (4) \[4899\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[4900\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4901\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4902\]

Thus indeed Venerable Labujadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Labujadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Breadfruit Donor.” This same *apadāna* (with the slight difference that the fifth and sixth verses are inverted there) appears above, with the same title in BJTS (PTS gives Labujaphaladāyaka), as \#379 \[382\], above. It also appears below, titled *Nāḷikeradāyakaº*, with the slight change of the first foot of the second verse to read “coconut” rather than “breadfruit”

[^3]: *ārāmika*, lit., “hermitage attendant” or “hermitage dweller”

[^4]: Artocarpus lacucha or incisa; Sinh. *del*. The fruit of the tree is cooked and eaten as a starchy vegetable.

[^5]: lit., “from where to there” (*yahiŋ tahiŋ*, PTS) or “from there to there” (*tahiṃ tahiṃ*, BJTS and PTS alt.)

[^6]: PTS treats these as two verses of six feet each; BJTS treats them as three typical four-footed verses. BJTS is presumably correct, since the parallel *apadāna*,
