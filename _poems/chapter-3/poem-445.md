*\[442. {445.}*[^1] *Utuḷhipupphiya*[^2]*\]*

Taking an *utuḷhi* flower,

I offered it to the Bodhi,

when \[that\] banyan[^3] tree had grown large,

in the golden-colored sunlight.[^4] (1) \[4747\]

Within the \[present\] aeon, since

I offered a flower back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Bodhi-*pūjā*. (2) \[4748\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (3) \[4749\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4750\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4751\]

Thus indeed Venerable Utuḷhipupphiya[^5] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Utuḷhipupphiya[^6] Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “*Utuḷhi*-Flower-er.” BJTS reads *Uttalipupphiya,*
    “*Uttali-*Flower-er.”

[^3]: *nigrodhe, nigrodha =* Sinh. *nuga,* RD: the banyan or Indian
    fig-tree, Ficus Indica; Bot. dict.: milky fig tree, Ficus altissima
    (*Urti.*) The banyan was the Bodhi tree only of Kassapa Buddha, the
    twenty-third Buddha of *Buddhavaṃsa* and third of the five Buddhas
    of the present “auspicious” or “lucky” (*bhadda*) aeon (Gotama is
    the fourth, Maitreya will be the fifth); thus the text inadvertently
    indicates that this offering was made in the Kassapa Buddha-era.

[^4]: I take *haritobhāsa* as *haritā + obhāsa,* but it could also be
    *harita + obhāsa* = splendorous pale green, modifying the tree,
    which seems to be BJTS’ preferred reading (gloss: *nil-pähä äti*,
    “having blue color”). I also take the string of locatives as an
    absolute construction (“when...”) whereas BJTS treats them as
    straightforward locatives, with the protagonist taking a flower *on*
    the banyan tree. BJTS seems to misunderstand *nigrodha,* glossing it
    *nāgabodhirukṣayehi*, “on the ironwood bodhi tree.” Ironwood was the
    Bodhi tree of four previous Buddhas (Maṅgala, Sumana, Revata and
    Sobhita) but all of them lived before the present aeon.

[^5]: BJTS reads *Uttalipupphiya,* “*Uttali-*Flower-er.”

[^6]: BJTS reads *Uttalipupphiya,* “*Uttali-*Flower-er.”
