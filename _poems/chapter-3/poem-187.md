*\[187. Ekacintita*[^1]*\]*  
When according to \[his\] lifespan,  
a god falls from the world,[^2]  
three sayings[^3] get emitted \[then,\]  
\[in\] the rejoicing of the gods. (1) \[2185\][^4]  
“From here, sir,[^5] go to a good state,  
in the company of people.  
Becoming human do obtain  
great faith in the Excellent Truth.[^6] (2) \[2186\]

“Having established that, your faith,  
in the well-known Excellent Truth,  
\[well-\]fixed, born of \[those happy\] roots,  
\[be\] steadfast as long as \[you\] live. (3) \[2187\]

“Doing good \[deeds\][^7] with \[your\] body,  
\[and doing\] much good[^8] with \[your\] speech;  
doing good[^9] with \[your\] mind \[as well,\]  
\[be\] free of hate and attachment.[^10] (4) \[2188\]

“Thus exalting the life \[you live\],  
doing merit with much giving,  
make other men also enter  
the chaste life \[and\] Excellent Truth.” (5) \[2189\]

When gods know that a god’s falling,[^11]  
\[filled\] with this \[sort of\] compassion,  
they rejoice \[about his rebirth\]:  
“O god come \[back\] repeatedly.” (6) \[2190\]

I was moved when at that time the  
assembly of gods had gathered,  
“Well now then to what womb should I  
go when \[I have\] fallen from here?” (7) \[2191\]

Padumuttara’s follower,  
known by the name of Sumana,[^12]  
a monk with senses \[well-\]controlled,  
realizing that I was moved  
\[and\] desiring to lift me up,  
did come into my presence then  
\[and\] stirred me up instructing \[me\]  
in the meaning and the Teaching.[^13] (8-9) \[2192-2193\]  
Having listened to his words, I  
made my heart pleased in the Buddha.  
Having saluted that wise \[monk,\]  
I \[then\] passed away on the spot. (10) \[2194\]

I was reborn right then and there,  
incited by \[those\] happy roots.  
For one hundred thousand aeons  
I was not born in a bad state.[^14] (11) \[2195\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[2196\]
