*\[96. Tipupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
In the past, in a forest grove,  
I was a man who hunted deer.  
Seeing \[Buddha’s\] green *pāṭali*[^2]  
I scattered three flowers \[on it\]. (1) \[1582\]

Then picking up the fallen[^3] leaves  
I threw them \[all\] away outside.  
Worshipping the *pāṭali* \[tree\],  
pure inside and pure outside \[too\],  
as though facing the Sambuddha,  
Vipassi, Leader of the World,  
well-liberated, undefiled,  
I passed away \[right\] on the spot.[^4] (2-3) \[1583-1584\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I performed that Bodhi-*pūjā,*  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Bodhi-*pūjā.* (4) \[1585\]

In the thirtieth aeons hence  
there were thirteen kings who were \[all\]  
named Samantapāsādika,[^5]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (5) \[1586\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1587\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tipupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Tipupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Three-Flower-er”

[^2]: the *pāṭali* or trumpet-flower tree (Sinh. *paḷol gasa*) was the
    tree under which Vipassi Buddha attained Bodhi or Awakening, hence
    it is his “Bodhi Tree” even though it is a species different from
    the “Bodhi Tree” of Gotama Buddha, the *ficus religiosa* (Skt.
    *Aśvattha*).

[^3]: reading *patita* (BJTS alt) for *satta* (“seven,” PTS, BJTS,
    though BJTS Sinhala gloss takes it as meaning “fallen” \[Sinhala
    *väṭunu*).

[^4]: “Sambuddha, Vipassi, World Lord, well-liberated, undefiled” are
    all accusatives which, in addition to explicating the phrase “facing
    the Sambuddha”, therefore stand in grammatical apposition with
    *pāṭali.* He worships the tree “as though facing the Sambuddha”
    because, in this reading, the tree *is* the Buddha.

[^5]: “Pleased on all Sides.” This (coincidentally, I presume) is the
    name of Buddhaghosa’s commentary on the *Vinaya-piṭaka* (5th c.,
    A.D.).
