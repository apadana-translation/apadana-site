*\[521. {524.}*[^1] *Abbhañjanadāyaka*[^2]*\]*

In the city, Bandhumatī,

I lived in the royal garden.

I was then clothed in deer-leather,[^3]

carrier of a water-pot. (1) \[5561\]

I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,

the Self-Become, Unconquered One,

Energetic,[^4] Meditator,

Lover of Trances, the Master,[^5]

Successful in All the Pleasures,

Flood-Crosser, the Undefiled One.

Having seen \[him,\] pleased and happy,

I gave some unguent[^6] \[to him.\] (2-3) \[5562-5563\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I gave \[him\] that unguent then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of unguent. (4) \[5564\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (5) \[5565\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5566\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[5567\]

Thus indeed Venerable Abbhañjanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Abbhañjanadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Unguent Donor.” Cf. \#274, above, for a different *apadāna*
    ascribed to a monk with the same name.

[^3]: reading *cammavāsī* with BJTS (and PTS alt.) for PTS *dhammavādī*
    (“a speaker of the truth” or “a speaker of the Teaching” \[or
    perhaps, more appropriately, “a debater of doctrines”?\]). The
    latter -- or the alt. reading *cammavāsī --* is preferable given the
    other epithet applied to the protagonist here, “carrier of a
    water-pot (*kamaṇḍaludharo*),” which like the deer-leather robe is a
    distinctive mark of non-Buddhist adepts.

    rubbing on the body”)
