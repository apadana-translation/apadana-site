*\[479. {482.}*[^1] *Buddhasaññaka*[^2]*\]*

In \[reading\] marks[^3] and history,[^4]

with glosses[^5] \[and\] ritual law,

\[I was\] learned, mantra-knowing,[^6]

a master of the three Vedas. (1) \[5039\]

\[Many\] students came to me then,

resembling a river stream.

I am teaching mantras to them,

night and day, \[I am\] not lazy. (2) \[5040\]

The Sambuddha named Siddhattha

arose in the world at that time.

Having driven out the darkness,

he displayed the light of knowledge. (3) \[5041\]

A certain one of my students

conversed with[^7] my \[other\] students;

having heard the fact \[he discussed\],

they then announced \[the fact\] to me: (4) \[5042\]

“A Buddha’s risen in the world,

an Omniscient One, World-Leader.

The people are turning to him;

we’re not going to get \[anything\].”[^8] (5) \[5043\]

“Buddhas are Born Spontaneously,[^9]

\[those\] Eyeful Ones, Greatly Famed Ones.

Why then don’t I also \[go\] see

the Best Buddha, the World-Leader?”[^10] (6) \[5044\]

Having taken my deer-leather,

\[my\] robes of bark, \[and\] water-pot,[^11]

departing from \[my\] hermitage,

I advised \[my\] students \[like this\]: (7) \[5045\]

“Like a glomerous fig tree bloom,[^12]

\[and\] like the rabbit in the moon,[^13]

\[and\] like the \[mother’s\] milk of crows,[^14]

a World-Leader’s hard to obtain. (8) \[5046\]

A Buddha’s risen in the world!

Even human birth’s hard to get,

and hearing’s[^15] very hard to get,

when both of them occur \[at once\]. (9) \[5047\]

A Buddha’s risen in the world!

We’ll get to see \[him in\] our lives.[^16]

Come, we will \[now\] all go into

the Sammāsambuddha’s presence.” (10) \[5048\]

They all were holding water-pots,

\[and\] dressed in rough \[bark and\] deer-hide.

They,[^17] bearing weights of matted hair,[^18]

then departed from the forest. (11) \[5049\]

Looking but a plough’s length ahead,[^19]

searching for ultimate meaning,

coming like baby elephants,

\[they were\] without fear, like lions. (12) \[5050\]

Free of cares and unwavering,[^20]

clever and living peacefully,

wandering about for gleaning,[^21]

they approached the Best of Buddhas. (13) \[5051\]

When a league and a half was left[^22]

\[to go\], illness arose in me.

Remembering the Best Buddha,

I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (14) \[5052\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I obtained that perception then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

the fruit of perceiving Buddhas. (15) \[5053\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (16) \[5054\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (17) \[5055\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (18) \[5056\]

Thus indeed Venerable Buddhasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Buddhasaññaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Buddha Perceiver”

[^3]: *lakkhaṇe*

[^4]: *itihāse*

[^5]: *sa-nighaṇḍu*

[^6]: lit., “mantra-bearer”

[^7]: lit., “to”

[^8]: *lābho amhaŋ na hessati,* lit., “there will not be receiving for
    us”

[^9]: pronounce as spontan’yasly (4 syllable) to keep the meter

[^10]: this verse is presumably thought by the protagonist upon hearing
    the worries of his students.

[^11]: like the deer-leather (*ajina*) and bark-robes (*vākacīraŋ*)*,*
    the water-pot (*kamaṇḍalu*, a long-spouted jar for carrying water)
    is a distinctive possession, and signifier of non-Buddhist ascetics

[^12]: *odumbarakapupphaŋ va. Odumbaraka* (BJTS *odumbarika*) means
    “related to the *udumbara* tree, which is Ficus Gomerata, Sinh.
    *dimbul.*

[^13]: *candamhi sasakaŋ yathā*

[^14]: cty (p. 488) explains, “”as milk is hard to obtain for (or of)
    crows due to their being oppressed by \[having\] little, day and
    night”

[^15]: i.e., hearing the Buddha, “a listening” *(savanaŋ*)

[^16]: lit., “we will receive eyes/vision our life”. BJTS gloss is weak
    here:

[^17]: PTS *Je* is obviously a typographical mistake for *Te* (BJTS’
    reading)

[^18]: *jaṭābhārabharitā* (PTS), *jaṭābhārena bharitā* (BJTS)

[^19]: *yugamattañ pekkhamānā,* lit., “looking ahead the extent of a
    plough,” i.e., just a little, keeping their eyes on the ground in
    front of them

[^20]: reading *appakiccā aloluppā* with BJTS for PTS *appabhāsā
    alīlatā,* “saying little and having no playfulness (or very
    serious),” a possible but unusual reading; both terms of the BJTS
    reading, unlike those of the PTS reading, have solid witness in
    other texts.

[^21]: *uñchāya caramānā*

[^22]: *diyaḍḍhayojane sese,* lit., “when a half less than two leagues
    remained,” following BJTS Sinhala gloss
