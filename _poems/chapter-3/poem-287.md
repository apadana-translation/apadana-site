### \[287. Apadāniya[^1]\]

I praised the *apadāna*\s of  
the Great Sages, the Well-Gone Ones,  
and worshipped them, head on \[their\] feet,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands. (1) \[2652\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I praised the *apadāna* \[poems\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of extolling. (2) \[2653\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2654\]

Thus indeed Venerable Apadāniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Apadāniya Thera is finished.
