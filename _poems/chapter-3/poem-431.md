## Ekavihāriya Chapter, the Forty-Fourth

### \[428. {431.}[^1] Ekavihāriya[^2]\]

In this \[present\] lucky aeon  
Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,  
named Kassapa through \[his\] lineage,[^3]  
Best Debater, \[Buddha\] arose. (1) \[4630\]

Non-Delayed One,[^4] Unsupported,[^5]  
Whose Mind is as Level as Space,[^6]  
Very Empty,[^7] Neutral,[^8] Not Fond  
of Appearances,[^9] the Master,[^10] (2) \[4631\]

Heart Unattached,[^11] Defilement-Free,[^12]  
Not Mixing in the clan \[and\] group,[^13]  
Greatly Compassionate, Hero,  
Skilled in means of disciplining,[^14] (3) \[4632\]

Active in duties to others,[^15]  
Training \[the whole world\] with \[its\] gods,[^16]  
Drying Up the muddiness on  
road that leads to nirvana —  
undying, supreme enjoyment,[^17]  
obstacle to old age and death[^18] —  
the One Who Helps the World Across[^19]  
was seated amidst a huge crowd. (4-5) \[4633-4634\]

Lord,[^20] with the Voice of a Cuckoo,[^21]  
the Sound of Brahmā,[^22] Thus-Gone-One,[^23]  
Lifting \[those on\] very bad roads[^24]  
who are lost[^25] without a Leader,[^26] (6) \[4635\]

preaching the stainless Teaching \[then,\]  
the World-Leader was seen by me.  
Having listened to his Teaching,  
I went forth into homelessness. (7) \[4636\]

Going forth, I was then thinking  
of the Victor’s dispensation;  
weighed down by associations,  
I lived alone in lovely woods. (8) \[4637\]

Physical solitude became  
the great condition[^27] \[then\] for me,  
possessed of mental solitude,  
looking at meetings fearfully.[^28] (9) \[4638\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (10) \[4639\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[4640\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[4641\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekavihāriya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekavihāriya Thera is finished.
