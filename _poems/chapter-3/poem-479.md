### \[476. {479.}[^1] Pānadhidāyaka[^2]\]

Anomadassi, Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
gone out during the siesta,  
got on the road, the Eyeful One. (1) \[5006\]

Taking a well-made pair of shoes,  
I \[also\] went along the road.  
There I saw \[him\], the Sambuddha,  
Carrying a Bowl,[^3] Good-Looking.[^4] (2) \[5007\]

Bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart,  
taking out[^5] those shoes \[that I had\],  
placing them at the \[Buddha’s\] feet,  
I spoke these words \[to him back then\]: (3) \[5008\]

“Put on[^6] \[these shoes\], O Sage So Great,  
O Well-Gone-One, O Lord, O Guide.  
I will receive the fruit from this;  
let the purpose succeed for me!” (4) \[5009\]

Anomadassi, Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
after having put on \[those\] shoes,  
spoke these words \[about me back then\]: (5) \[5010\]

“This one who gave \[these\] shoes to me,  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[his\] own hands,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words:” (6) \[5011\]

Knowing that Buddha would speak,[^7] the  
gods all came together \[there then\],  
happy, stirred up with emotion,  
thrilled, with their hands together. (7) \[5012\]

“Due to \[this\] offering of shoes,  
this one is going to be happy,  
and fifty-five \[different\] times,  
he will exercise divine rule. (8) \[5013\]

A thousand times he’ll be a king,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\],  
\[And there will be\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (9) \[5014\]

Aeons beyond measure from now,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (10) \[5015\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled. (11) \[5016\]

Merit-filled, he’ll be reborn in  
the world of the gods or of men;  
he will receive vehicles, which  
resemble divine vehicles.” (12) \[5017\]

My palaces and palanquins,  
ornamented elephants and  
chariots yoked with thoroughbreds  
are always appearing for me. (13) \[5018\]

\[When\] I’m departing from the house,  
I depart on[^8] a chariot.  
When my hair was being cut off,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (14) \[5019\]

The gain for me was well-received,  
that \[carefully\] hiring merchants,  
\[then\] giving \[just\] one \[pair of\] shoes,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state. (15) \[5020\]

During aeons beyond measure  
since I gave \[those\] shoes \[at that time\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[a pair of\] shoes. (16) \[5021\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (17) \[5022\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (18) \[5023\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (19) \[5024\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pānadhidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pānadhidāyaka Thera is finished.
