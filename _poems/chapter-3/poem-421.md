## Sakiŋsammajjaka Chapter, the Forty-Third

### \[418. {421.}[^1] Sakiŋsammajjaka[^2]\]

Having seen the chief of \[all\] trees,  
the trumpet-flower[^3] Bodhi tree  
of Vipassi, the Blessed One,  
I brought pleasure to \[my\] heart there. (1) \[4462\]

Having taken a broom \[with me,\]  
I always swept that Bodhi tree.  
After sweeping that Bodhi tree,  
I worshipped the trumpet-flower. (2) \[4463\]

Bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart there,  
hands pressed together on \[my\] head,  
praising \[that\] Bodhi tree I \[then,\]  
crouched over,[^4] departed \[from there\]. (3) \[4464\]

Going along a walking path,[^5]  
remembering the supreme tree,[^6]  
\[at that time\] a python[^7] crushed me,  
of frightful form, extremely strong. (4) \[4465\]

Due to the fruit of my karma,[^8]  
being near death[^9] I was happy.  
\[The python\] swallowed my body;[^10]  
I delighted in the gods’ world. (5) \[4466\]

My mind is always undisturbed,  
well-purified and very clear.[^11]  
I do not know arrows of grief,  
\[nor any\] torment in my heart. (6) \[4467\]

I do not get the itch,[^12] ringworm,[^13]  
rashes,[^14] abscesses,[^15] leprosy,[^16]  
epilepsy[^17] \[and\] scabies[^18] \[too\]:  
that is the fruit of sweeping \[up\]. (7) \[4468\]

Grief as well as lamentation  
are[^19] not known in \[this\] heart of mine.  
My mind’s upright and unattached:[^20]  
that is the fruit of sweeping \[up\]. (8) \[4469\]

My mind is pure, I do not cling  
when in the meditative states.[^21]  
Whichever of those states[^22] I want,  
it \[always\] comes to be for me. (9) \[4470\]

I’m not attached to lustful \[ways\]  
and also \[not to\] hateful \[ones\];  
not bewildered in ignorance:  
that is the fruit of sweeping \[up\]. (10) \[4471\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that karma at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of sweeping \[up\]. (11) \[4472\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (12) \[4473\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (13) \[4474\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[4475\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sakiŋsammajjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sakiŋsammajjaka Thera is finished.
