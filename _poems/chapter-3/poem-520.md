### \[517. {520.}[^1] Padumadhāriya[^2]\]

Close to the Himalayan range,  
there’s a mountain named Romasa.[^3]  
The Buddha known as Sambhava  
then dwelt there in the open air. (1) \[5532\]

Coming out of \[my\] residence,  
I brought[^4] \[him\] a lotus \[flower\].  
Having brought a single one,  
I went forward into rebirth. (2) \[5533\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I offered[^5] \[him\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[5534\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5535\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5536\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5537\]

Thus indeed Venerable Padumadhāriya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Padumadhāriya Thera is finished.

The Summary:

Kureñjiya and Kapittha,  
Kosumbha, also Ketaka,  
Nāgapupph’, also Ajjuna,  
Kuṭajī, Ghosasaññaka,  
and Sabbaphalada Thera,  
then Padumadhārika \[tenth\]:  
there are eighty verses here, plus  
three verses more than that \[number\].

The Kureñjiyaphaladāyaka Chapter, the Fifty-Second[^6]

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Pink Lotus Bearer” Virtually the same *apadāna* ascribed to a monk with a similar name (*Padumapūjaka* = “Pink Lotus Offerer”) and differing only in giving ninety-one rather than thirty-one as the number of aeons ago when the good karma was done, and providing only the third verse of the three-verse concluding refrain, is presented above as \#344 {347}

[^3]: I am unclear about the meaning of this name, which is virtually unique to, and with different referents recurs in, *Apadāna*

[^4]: *dhārayim*, “carried,” “brought,” “had”

[^5]: lit., “did *pūjā*”

[^6]: BJTS places this line before, rather than after the summary.
