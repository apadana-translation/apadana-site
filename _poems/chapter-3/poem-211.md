*Hatthi Chapter, the Twenty-Second*  
*\[211. Hatthidāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
I gifted a fine elephant,  
with tusks like plough-poles, fully grown,  
to Siddhattha, the Blessed One,  
Lord of Bipeds, the Neutral One. (1) \[2319\]  
I grasp the ultimate meaning,  
the unsurpassed pathway to peace.  
I gave a very costly gift  
to the Well-Wisher of All Worlds.[^2] (2) \[2320\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that gift at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of giving elephants. (3) \[2321\]  
In the seventy-eighth aeon  
there were sixteen of royal caste,[^3]  
named Samantapāsādika,[^4]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (4) \[2322\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2323\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Hatthidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Hatthidāyaka Thera is finished.
