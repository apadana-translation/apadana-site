*Citapūjaka*[^1] *Chapter, the Thirtieth*

*\[291. Citapūjaka*[^2]*\]*

At that time I was a brahmin,

known by the name of Ajita.[^3]

Wishing to do a sacrifice,[^4]

I’d gathered various flowers. (1) \[2671\]

After seeing[^5] the burning pyre,

of Sikhi, Kinsman of the World,

gathering those flowers \[again\]

I strew \[them\] on \[that burning\] pyre. (2) \[2672\]

In the thirty-one aeons since

I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2673\]

In the twenty-seventh aeon

hence, there were seven lords of men.

They were named Supajjalita,[^6]

wheel-turning kings with great strength. (4) \[2674\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2675\]

Thus indeed Venerable Citapūjaka[^7] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Citapūjaka[^8] Thera is finished.
