### \[149. Vaṭaṃsakiya[^1]\]

The Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
\[the Buddha\] known as Sumedha,  
strengthening \[his\] separation,  
went off into a great forest. (1) \[1983\]

Having seen a *sal* tree blooming,  
I bound up a hair-wreath \[right then\].  
Face to face with the World-Leader,  
I gave \[that wreath\] to the Buddha. (2) \[1984\]

In the thirty-thousand aeons  
since I offered \[him\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[1985\]

In the nineteen-hundredth aeon  
there were sixteen \[named\] Nimmita,[^2]  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (4) \[1986\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1987\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vaṭaṃsakiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Vaṭaṃsakiya Thera is finished.
