*\[132. Sudassana*[^1]*\]*  
On the Vitattha[^2] River’s bank,  
\[there\] was a fig tree[^3] bearing fruit.  
While I was searching for that tree  
I saw the Leader of the World. (1) \[1879\]

Seeing a pandanus[^4] in bloom,  
after having cut off a stalk,  
I gifted \[it\] to the Buddha,  
Sikhi, the Kinsman of the World. (2) \[1880\]

“Whatever knowledge you’ve attained  
of the eternal, deathless, state,  
I sing that knowledge’s praises,  
O Best Buddha, O Sage so Great.” (3) \[1881\]

Doing *pūjā* \[thus\] for knowledge,  
I \[then\] saw the \[fruiting\] fig tree;  
I have obtained that perception:  
that’s the fruit of knowledge-*pūjā.* (4) \[1882\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I offered that flower \[to him,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of knowledge-*pūjā.* (5) \[1883\]

In the thirteenth aeon ago  
there were twelve \[named\] Phaluggata,[^5]  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (6) \[1884\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1885\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sudassana Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sudassana Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Good to Look At”  
[^2]: PTS reads *vitthatāya nadītire,* “on a wide river bank”. I follow
    BJTS in the spelling of the proper name.  
[^3]: lit., “*pilakkha* \[tree\]” (Sinh. *pulila*), the wave-leaved fig
    tree.  
[^4]: *ketaka* or *ketakī* (Sinhala *väṭakē* or *väṭakeyiyā*)  
[^5]: “Fruit Risen Up.” This is the BJTS spelling; PTS gives Khaluggata,
    “Surely RIsen Up.”
