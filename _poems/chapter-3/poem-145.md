*\[145. Ummāpupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
When Siddhattha, the Blessed One,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the World-Worshipped One passed away,[^2]  
a stupa festival[^3] took place. (1) \[1961\]

While the festival proceeded  
for Siddhattha the Sage so Great,  
taking a \[blue\] flax flower[^4] \[then  
I placed \[it\] upon the stupa. (2) \[1962\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I offered that flower \[there then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of stupa-*pūjā.* (3) \[1963\]

And in the ninth aeon ago  
there were five and eighty monarchs.  
\[All\] were known as Somadeva,[^5]  
wheel-turning kings with great power. (4) \[1964\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1965\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ummāpupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ummāpupphiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Blue Flax*-*Flower-er”. cf. \#321. *Ummāpuppha* (Skt. *umāpuṣpa*)
    refers to the flowers of Linum usitatissimum, Linseed. The small
    flowers of this fiber-bearing plant are distinctively and deeply
    blue in color, and the seeds, as the English name implies, bear a
    useful oil.  
[^2]: lit., “reached nirvana”  
[^3]: lit., “a great stupa festival” or “a large stupa festival”  
[^4]: *ummā-pupphaŋ*  
[^5]: “God Soma” or “Moon God”.
