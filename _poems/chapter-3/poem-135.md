*\[135. Rahosaññaka*[^1]*\]*  
Close to the Himalayan range,  
there is a mountain called Vasabha.  
My ashram is made very well  
\[there\] at the foot of that mountain. (1) \[1902\]

For three thousand years that brahmin  
uttered \[his teachings\] at that time.  
Drawing the students together,[^2]  
he dwelt \[there, sitting\] to one side. (2) \[1903\]

The brahmin master of mantras,  
while sitting \[there\] off to one side,  
searching the Buddha’s knowledge,[^3]  
pleased his heart over knowledge \[then\]. (3) \[1904\]

After after pleasing \[my\] heart there,  
I sat[^4] on a mat made of leaves;  
getting into lotus posture,[^5]  
I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (4) \[1905\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I obtained that perception \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of perceiving knowledge. (5) \[1906\]

In the twenty-seventh aeon  
there was a king, Siridhara,[^6]  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (6) \[1907\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1908\]

Thus indeed Venerable Rahosaññaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Rahosaññaka Thera is finished.
