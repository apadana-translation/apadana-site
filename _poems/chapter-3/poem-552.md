*\[{552.}*[^1] *Nadī-Kassapa*[^2]*\]*

When Padumuttara Buddha,

the World’s Best One, the Neutral One,

was wandering about for alms,

maintaining superlative fame,

taking the best fruit \[of some sort\],

I gave \[it\] to \[him\], the Teacher, \[6359\]

The Biped-Lord,[^3] the World’s Best One,

Bull of Men. Due to that karma,

I’ve attained the unshaking state

beyond \[all\] conquest and defeat. \[6360\]

In the hundred thousand aeons

since I gave that donation then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of giving the best. \[6361\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. \[6362\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6363\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6364\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nadīkassapa Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Nadīkassapa Thera, the second.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Kassapa by the River,” a historical monk, brother of
    Uruvela-Kassapa (see v. 36-38 of Uruvela-Kassapa’s *apadāna,*
    \[5946\]-\[5948\], above); cf. DPPN II:10. This same *apadāna*, with
    minor changes (the first two verses are conflated here, and one line
    is missing), appears above as \#437 {440}. There it is ascribed to a
    monk named Jambuphaliya, “Rose-apple Fruit-er,” and on the basis of
    that ascription BJTS Sinh. gloss says the type of “best fruit”
    referred to in the first (there second) verse was a rose-apple
    (*jambu*) fruit. Here, lacking that ascription, BJTS Sinh. gloss is
    silent as regards the type of fruit that was donated.

[^3]: I read this and the following two epithets in the vocative, in
    keeping with PTS, though BJTS reads them as nominatives, continuing
    the preceding verse, here and in the repeated version (\#{552}). See
    the latter for the treatment of them as nominatives.
