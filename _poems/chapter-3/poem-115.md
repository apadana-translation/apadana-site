*\[115. Suvaṇṇapupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
The Blessed One named Vipassi,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
sitting down, preached the deathless state  
to the body of people \[there\]. (1) \[1716\]

After having heard theTeaching[^2]  
of that Biped-Lord, Neutral One,  
I \[then\] offered to the Buddha  
four flowers made out of \[fine\] gold. (2) \[1717\]

There was a canopy of gold  
\[stretched\] over the whole crowd back then.  
From the Buddha’s light and[^3] the gold’s  
there was a vast effulgence \[there\]. (3) \[1718\]

Happy, with rapture in \[my\] heart,  
thrilled, with my hands pressed together,  
with joy produced for those \[who heard\],  
conveying pleasure to the world, (4) \[1719\]

having invited the Buddha,[^4]  
worshipping the Compliant One,[^5]  
experiencing great delight  
I \[then\] returned to \[my\] own house. (5) \[1720)  
Having entered \[my\] residence,  
I called to mind the Best Buddha.  
Due to that pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I was reborn in Tusitā. (6) \[1721\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I offered that flower \[to him,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (7) \[1722\]

There were sixteen \[different\] kings \[then,\]  
\[all\] known as Nemisammata,[^6]  
in the forty-third aeon hence,  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (8) \[1723\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1724\]

Thus indeed Venerable Suvaṇṇapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Suvaṇṇapupphiya Thera is finished.
