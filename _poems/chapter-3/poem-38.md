*\[38. Āyāgadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
When the World’s Protector had died,  
Sikhi \[Buddha\], Best Debater,  
I worshipped his superb stupa,  
happy, \[and\] with a happy heart. (1) \[1096\]

Having spoken with the workmen  
I provided the capital;[^2]  
I constructed an eating hall,  
happy, \[and\] with a happy heart. (2) \[1097\]

\[After that\] I lived among gods  
for eight aeons without a break.  
In the remaining aeons I  
transmigrated in a mixture.[^3] (3) \[1098\]

Poisons don’t enter my body,  
enemies are not hurting me,  
I do not sink down in water:  
that’s the fruit of an eating hall. (4) \[1099\]

A massive cloud rains \[heavy\] rain  
whenever I \[may\] wish \[for it\].  
Even gods[^4] visit my dwelling;  
that is the fruit of good karma. (5) \[1100\]

Thirty times as wheel-turning kings,  
possessors of the seven gems;  
no one at all despises me:  
that is the fruit of good karma. (6) \[1101\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I had that hall for eating made,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of an eating hall. (7) \[1102\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[1103\]

Thus indeed Venerable Āyāgadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Āyāgadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: cty defines *āyāga* as a *dighaṃ bhojanasālaṃ* or “long
    eating-hall,” thus the name would mean “Eating-Hall-Giver”.

[^2]: lit., “root,” *mūla.*

[^3]: i.e., in a mixture of human and divine worlds.

[^4]: or “kings,” *devā*.
