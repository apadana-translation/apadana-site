*Sālakusumiya Chapter, the Forty-Seventh*  
*\[458. {461.}*[^1] *Sālakusumiya*[^2]*\]*  
When the Blessed One passed away —  
the one whose name was “Best Lotus” —  
when the funeral pyre was raised,  
I offered[^3] a *sal-*flower[^4] there. (1) \[4864\]  
In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I presented that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of worshipping[^5] pyres. (2) \[4865\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4866\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4867\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4868\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Sālakusumiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sālakusumiya Thera is finished.
