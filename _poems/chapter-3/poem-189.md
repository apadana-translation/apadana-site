*\[189. Ekacāriya*[^1]*\]*  
At that time a great din arose  
among the Tāvatiṃsa gods:  
“The world’s Buddha has passed away[^2]  
and we’re \[still\] afflicted with lust.” (1) \[2202\]  
Among them who had \[thus\] been moved,  
afflicted with arrows of grief,  
made firm by \[my\] own \[mental\][^3] strength,  
I went into Buddha’s presence. (2) \[2203\]  
Plucking a *mandārava* bloom,  
tender, created with magic,  
I \[then\] offered \[it\] at the time  
of the Buddha’s Passing Away.[^4] (3) \[2204\]  
All the gods and celestial  
nymphs rejoiced for me at that time.  
For one hundred thousand aeons  
I was not born in a bad state.[^5] (4) \[2205\]  
Sixty thousand aeons ago  
there were \[born\] sixteen \[great\] people  
\[all\] named Mahāmallajana[^6]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (5) \[2206\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2207\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Ekacāriya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ekacāriya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Once Practicer”  
[^2]: “reached nirvana”  
[^3]: I follow BJTS in assuming the implied *citta* here  
[^4]: reading *parinibbāṇakālamhi* with BJTS for PTS
    *parinibbānākālamhi*  
[^5]: *duggatiŋ nûpapajj’ ahaŋ*  
[^6]: this reading follows BJTS; PTS gives the name as Mahāmallājanā.
    The meaning is “Great Wrestling Men”.
