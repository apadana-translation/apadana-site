*\[269. Upāgatabhāsaniya*[^1]*\]*  
Amidst the Himalayan \[mounts,\]  
there was a well-apportioned lake.  
I was a demon[^2] in that place,  
with low morals,[^3] terrifying. (1) \[2573\]  
Vipassi, Leader of the World,  
Merciful, Compassionate One,  
did come into my presence \[then,\]  
with a desire to lift me up. (2) \[2574\]  
Going forth with expectation,  
I paid homage to the Teacher,  
the Great Hero who had arrived,  
the God of Gods, the Bull of Men. (3) \[2575\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I worshipped the Supreme Person,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of worshipping. (4) \[2576\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2577\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Upāgatabhāsaniya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Upāgatabhāsaniya Thera is finished.
