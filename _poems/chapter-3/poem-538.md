*\[535. {538.}*[^1] *Uruvelakassapa*[^2]*\]*  
The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the Sage, Knower of Every World,  
the One who had \[Five\] Eyes, arose  
a hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[5911\][^3]  
The Admonisher,[^4] Instructor,[^5]  
Crosser-Over[^6] of all that breathe,  
Skilled at Preaching,[^7] \[he\], the Buddha,  
caused many folks to cross \[the flood\]. (2) \[5912\]

Merciful,[^8] Compassionate One,[^9]  
Well-Wisher[^10] of all that breathe, he  
established in the five precepts  
all the rivals who had arrived. (3) \[5913\]

In this way he was Unconfused[^11]  
and Very Well-Known[^12] by rivals,  
Ornamented[^13] by arahants  
who were masters \[and\] neutral ones. (4) \[5914\]

The \[body of the\] Sage So Great  
rose up fifty-eight cubits[^14] \[tall\];  
he was Valuable Like Gold,[^15]  
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. (5) \[5915\]

\[People’s\] lifespan at that time was  
\[fully\] one hundred thousand years.  
Remaining \[in the world\] so long,  
he ferried many folks across. (6) \[5916\]

I then \[lived\] in Haṃsavatī,  
A brahmin held in high regard.  
Approaching the Torch for the World,[^16]  
I heard the preaching of *Dhamma*. (7) \[5917\]

\[One\] of the Great Man’s[^17] followers  
had an extensive retinue.  
I was thrilled after hearing \[him\]  
being placed in that foremost place. (8) \[5918\]

Inviting \[him\], the Great Victor,[^18]  
I gave an almsgiving \[to him\],  
along with \[my\][^19] large entourage,  
including a thousand brahmins. (9) \[5919\]

Giving a massive almsgiving,  
having saluted the Leader,  
happy, standing off at one side,  
I spoke these words \[to him just then\]: (10) \[5920\]

“Hero, due to my faith in you  
and by virtue of serving \[you\],  
let \[me\] have[^20] a large retinue  
\[while\] transmigrating here and there.” (11) \[5921\]

\[Buddha\], the Cuckoo-Voiced[^21] Teacher,  
Elephant-Trumpet-Sounding One,[^22]  
spoke to the retinue \[just\] then:  
“All of you look at this brahmin,  
with big arms, the color of gold,  
\[with\] face and eyes \[like\] lotuses,  
\[his\] body hair growing upward,  
happy, with faith in my virtue.[^23] (12-13) \[5922-5923\]  
This one’s aspiring to the place  
of the monk with a lion’s roar.[^24]  
Very far into the future,  
he’ll receive that delightful \[place\]. (14) \[5924\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (15) \[5925\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
the one whose name is Kassapa  
will be the Teacher’s follower.” (16) \[5926\]

\[Then\] ninety-two aeons ago,  
there was a Teacher, Unsurpassed,[^25]  
Beyond Compare,[^26] Unrivaled One:[^27]  
Phussa, Chief Leader of the World. (17) \[5927\]

That one, having slain all darkness,  
untangling the great tangle,[^28]  
rained forth the rain of deathlessness,  
refreshing the \[world\] with \[its\] gods. (18) \[5928\]

In \[the city of\] Benares,  
\[reborn\] the king’s sons[^29] at that time,  
we were three brothers, all of us,  
in the confidence of the king. (19) \[5929\]

Strong, with heroic limbs \[and\] looks,[^30]  
\[we’re\] undefeated in battle.  
Then troubled in the borderlands,  
the lord of the earth said to us: (20) \[5930\]

“Come, going to the borderlands,  
cleaning up that forest army,[^31]  
having pacified my kingdom,  
come back again,” \[is what\] he said. (21) \[5931\]

Afterward we said \[to the king\]:  
“If you’ll give \[leave\] to us to serve  
the \[Buddha\], Leader \[of the World\],  
then we’ll clean up your[^32] \[enemies\].” (22) \[5932\]

Then we, having obtained our wish,  
sent out by the earth’s protector,  
making the borderlands weapon-  
free, we came up to him again. (23) \[5933\]

Having asked the king \[to let us\]  
serve the Teacher, the World-Leader,  
getting the Excellent Sage,[^33] we  
worshipped[^34] him as long as \[we\] lived. (24) \[5934\]

Giving very expensive cloth,  
and abundant[^35] tasty \[alms food\],  
and lodgings[^36] \[which were\] delightful,  
and beneficial[^37] medicines  
to the Sage with the monks,[^38] neutral  
toward birth because of the Teaching,  
We, moral \[and\] compassionate,  
minds engaged in meditation,  
with loving hearts, having waited  
on the \[World-\]Leader all the time,  
when the World-Chief reached nirvana,  
worshipping[^39] with all of \[our\] strength,[^40] (25-27)
\[5935-5937\]  
fallen from there, gone to heaven,[^41]  
all \[three\] of us experienced  
great happiness \[when\] in that place:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (28) \[5938\]

Like an illusionist on stage[^42]  
showing \[himself as\] very large,  
thus touring[^43] in existence I  
became the king of Videha.[^44] (29) \[5939\]

At the word of naked[^45] Guṇa,[^46]  
become[^47] dependent on wrong views,[^48]  
I got onto an evil path.  
Not heeding[^49] the advice \[given\]  
by my daughter \[known as\] Rujā,[^50]  
I \[later\] being much-advised  
by the brahmin \[named\] Nārada,[^51]  
giving up \[Guṇa’s\] evil views,  
having fulfilled with distinction  
the[^52] ten \[wholesome\] ways of acting,[^53]  
abandoning \[my\] body, I  
went to heaven with a palace. (30-32) \[5940-5942\]  
When \[my\] last rebirth was attained,  
I was a kinsman of Brahmā,  
born in Benares with great wealth,[^54]  
in a large brahmin family.[^55] (33) \[5943\]

Fearing death, illness \[and\] old age,  
and abandoning \[my\] great wealth,  
seeking the path to nirvana,  
I went forth as a Jaṭila.[^56] (34) \[5944\]

\[And\] then those two brothers of mine  
\[also\] went forth along with me.  
Having built in Uruvelā  
a hermitage, I \[then\] lived there. (35) \[5945\]

Named “Kassapa” through \[my\] lineage,  
since I dwelt in Uruvelā,  
I was therefore known \[by the name\]  
of “Uruvela Kassapa.”[^57] (36) \[5946\]

My brother \[lived\] near the river;[^58]  
he was named “Nadī Kassapa.”  
\[The other lived\] close to Gāyā;  
by name he’s “Gāyā Kassapa”. (37) \[5947\]

Two hundred for Nadīkassapa,  
\[and\] three for the middle brother.  
No less than five hundred for me,  
students who all \[then\] followed me. (38) \[5948\]

Then the Buddha, approaching me,  
the World-Chief, Charioteer of Men,  
doing various miracles,  
he led me \[on the correct path\]. (39) \[5949\]

I was \[ordained\], “come monk,” along  
with a lakh \[in my\] retinue;  
I attained \[my\] arahantship,  
together with all of them \[too\]. (40) \[5950\]

They and also many others  
were students attending on me.  
I was able to instruct \[them,\]  
as the Seventh Sage \[advised\] me. (41) \[5951\]

He placed me in the foremost place  
\[of those with a\] large retinue.  
O! the deed done for the Buddha  
\[certainly\] bore \[its\] fruit for me. (42) \[5952\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (43) \[5953\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (44) \[5954\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (45) \[5955\]

Thus indeed Venerable Uruvelakassapa Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Uruvelakassapa Thera is finished.

    latter is also a possible reading.

[^20]: *parisā mahatī hotu,* lit., “let there be \[to me\]”. This
    translation follows BJTS Sinhala gloss (*ē ē tanhi upadinnā vū maṭa
    mahat vū piris äti wēwā,* “let there be a large retinue for me being
    reborn in this and that place” ), but the construction is elastic
    enough to allow for other readings that would better emphasize the
    “sociokarmic” dimension here, that is, that an entire group of
    people both make and experience this karma, e.g., “let this retinue
    be great as \[it\] transmigrates here and there” or even “let this
    be a great retinue transmigrating here and there”.

    hair ascetic” or a tangle of tree branches (a thicket), but
    figuratively refers to the great tangle of desire. The verb,
    *vjaṭeti*, means “untangle” but has the connotation, as does the
    English equivalent, of explaining or unraveling.

    avidhībalaŋ* (“cleaning up that army without a method”). BJTS
    understands this as a \[rebel\] army which is hiding in the forest;
    it could also be read to mean “army of forest people,” the so-called
    “tribals” on the borderlands of India.

    as Aṅgati, king of Mithilā in Videha.

[^45]: i.e., the naked ascetic

[^46]: “Virtue.” In *Mahānāradakassapajātaka* he is depicted as

    therefore should indulge in only pleasures during the present one.

[^50]: “Pain”. *Mahānāradakassapajātaka* explains that at the end of two
