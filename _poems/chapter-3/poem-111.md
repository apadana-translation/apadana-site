## Mahāparivāra Chapter, the Twelfth

### \[111. Mahāparivāra[^1]\]

The Blessed One named Vipassi,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
entered Banduma City then  
with sixty-eight thousand \[arahants\]. (1) \[1677\]

Having come out from the city  
he went to the shrine of the lamps.[^2]  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
Sacrificial Recipient. (2) \[1678\]

Eighty thousand minor spirits[^3]  
who \[then\] attended reverently  
upon Indra and the Thirty-three  
\[were also there\] in my presence. (3) \[1679\]

When he rose from meditation,  
I picked up a piece of cloth \[there\].  
I worshipped \[him\] with my head \[bowed,\]  
\[then\] I gave it to the Great Sage: (4) \[1680\]

“O! the Buddha! O! the Teaching!  
O! our Teacher’s \[great\] achievement!  
Through the power of the Buddha  
he made the earth \[itself\] to quake.” (5) \[1681\]

And having seen that miracle,  
marvel making hair stand on end,  
I pleased \[my\] heart in the Buddha,  
the Biped-Lord, the Neutral One. (6) \[1682\]

Then I, having pleased \[my\] heart in  
the Biped-Lord, the Neutral One,  
giving that cloth to the Teacher,  
went up to \[him to take\] refuge. (7) \[1683\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (8) \[1684\]

In the fifteenth aeon ago  
there were sixteen \[named\] Vāhana,[^4]  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (9) \[1685\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[1686\]

Thus indeed Venerable Mahāparivāra Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Mahāparivāra Thera is finished.
