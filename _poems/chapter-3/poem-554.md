*\[{554.}*[^1] *Kimbila*[^2]*\]*  
When Kakusandha passed away,[^3]  
the Brahmin, the Perfected One,[^4]  
gathering *salala*[^5] flowers,  
I constructed a pavilion.[^6] \[6372\]

Having gone to Tāvatiṃsa,  
I received a supreme mansion.  
I surpassed \[all\] the other gods:  
that is the fruit of good karma. \[6373\]

Whether it’s the day or the night,  
walking back and forth or[^7] standing,  
I’m covered with *salala* blooms:  
that is the fruit of good karma. \[6374\]

Within just this \[present\] aeon[^8]  
since I \[thus\] worshipped[^9] the Buddha,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* \[6375\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. \[6376\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6377\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6378\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kimbila Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kimbila Thera, the fourth.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: the personal name of a historical monk, well known in the early texts. See DPPN I: 604-605 for details. This same *apadāna,* almost verbatim (the only difference is in the first verse of the concluding refrain; there “All defilements...” replaces the more common “Like elephants...” found here), is included above as \#395 {398}. There it is ascribed to a monk named Salaḷamaṇḍapiya (“*Salaḷa*-Pavilion-er”), apparently reflecting the nature of the formative gift described in this *apadāna. *

[^3]: lit., “reached nirvana”

[^4]: *vusīmati,* loc. of *vusīmant = vusitavant,* “one who has reached perfection” “the Master”

[^5]: BJTS Sinh.gloss = *hora,* Bot. Dict. = “large timber tree yielding rezin and oil, Dipterocarpus zeylanicus *(Dipterocarp.*)”

[^6]: lit., “I caused a pavilion (*maṇḍapa*) to be constructed,” caus. of *karoti*

[^7]: lit., “and,” *ca*

[^8]: Kakusandha Buddha lived at an earlier time in the present aeon, one of five Buddhas said to have done so. The author demonstrates awareness of -- and a solution that smoothes out -- the little wrinkle this creates in applying this typical refrain.

[^9]: lit., “did *pūjā*”
