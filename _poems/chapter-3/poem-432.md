*\[429. {432.}*[^1] *Ekasaṅkhiya*[^2]*\]*  
There was a large festival for  
Vipassi Buddha’s[^3] Bodhi \[tree\].  
The populace came together,  
worshipping[^4] \[that\] superb Bodhi. (1) \[4642\]

“Surely he’s no inferior,  
the one whose Bodhi \[tree\] this is;  
this will be a Best of Buddhas;”  
the Teacher’s \[tree\] should be worshipped.”[^5] (2) \[4643\]

After that, taking a conch shell,  
I attended \[that\] Bodhi tree.  
Blowing \[that conch shell\] every day,  
I worshipped the supreme Bodhi. (3) \[4644\]

Doing that karma when near death,  
I attained the world of the gods.  
\[When\] my \[human\] body fell down,  
I delighted in the gods’ world. (4) \[4645\]

Thrilled, happy, overjoyed, \[playing\][^6]  
sixty thousand instruments \[they\]  
give service to me all the time:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā,* (5) \[4646\]

I was[^7] seventy one kings \[named\]  
Sudassana[^8] in this aeon,  
lords of the grove of rose-apples,[^9]  
victorious on \[all\] four sides.[^10] (6) \[4647\]

The hundred types[^11] of instruments  
are waiting on me all the time.  
I’m enjoying \[my\] own karma:  
that is the fruit of attendance. (7) \[4648\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
drums are always sounding for me,  
even \[while\] in \[my\] mother’s womb. (8) \[4649\]

After serving the Sambuddha,  
after enjoying \[all that\] bliss,[^12]  
\[now\] I’ve attained the deathless state,  
auspicious, peaceful, unshaking. (9) \[4650\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that karma at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (10) \[4651\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (11) \[4652\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[4653\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (13) \[4654\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekasaṅkhiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ekasaṅkhiya Thera is finished.
