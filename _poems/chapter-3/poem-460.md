*\[457. {460.}*[^1] *Gandhapūjaka*[^2]*\]*  
When the pyres were constructed  
various scents[^3] were \[then\] gathered.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I offered[^4] a handful of scents. (1) \[4859\]  
In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I worshipped that pyre \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of worshipping[^5] pyres. (2) \[4860\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4861\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4862\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4863\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Gandhapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Gandhapūjaka Thera is finished.

The Jagatidāyaka Chapter, the Forty-Sixth  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Scent-Offerer”  
[^3]: i.e., perfumes, incense. Because the offering is of “a handful,” I
    take the “scent” in question to be some sort of scented resin akin
    to Sinh. *dummala* or frankincense, both of which come in the form
    of small pebbles.  
[^4]: lit., “did *pūjā*”  
[^5]: lit., “dong *pūjā*”  
[^6]: BJTS omits *ca*  
[^7]: PTS reads *Sattipaṇṇī*
