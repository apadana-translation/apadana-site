*\[244. Viravapupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
The World’s Leader went out \[then\]  
with one thousand flawless arahants.[^2]  
Plucking a *virava*[^3] flower,  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha. (1) \[2475\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (2) \[2476\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2477\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Viravapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Viravapupphiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Virava-Flower-er”. BJTS reads *Viraviº*  
[^2]: lit., “with one thousand who were free of *āsavas* (outflows,
    defilements)”
