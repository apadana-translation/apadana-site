*\[513. {516.}*[^1] *Ajjunapupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
On Candabhāgā River’s bank,  
I was a *kinnara*[^3] back then.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One. (1) \[5484\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
awe-struck,[^4] with hands pressed together,  
taking an arjuna[^5] flower,  
I worshipped[^6] the Self-Become One. (2) \[5485\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
leaving my *kinnara* body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (3) \[5486\]

Thirty-four times the lord of gods,  
I exercised divine rule \[there\].  
And ten times a wheel-turning king,  
I exercised overlordship.[^7] (4) \[5487\]

\[There was also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting.  
\[Like\] a seed sown[^8] in a good field  
is mine in the Self-Become One. (5) \[5488\]

Wholesome \[karma\] exists for me;  
I went forth into homelessness.  
Today I’m worthy of homage  
in the Buddha’s[^9] dispensation. (6) \[5489\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (7) \[5490\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[5491\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[5492\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ajjunapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ajjunapupphiya Thera is finished.
