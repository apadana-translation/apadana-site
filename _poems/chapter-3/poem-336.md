*\[333. {336.}*[^1] *Pabhaṅkara*[^2]*\]*  
In deep forest which was crowded  
with wild beasts there was a stupa[^3]  
of Blessed Padumuttara,  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One. (1) \[2984\]

Nobody dared to travel \[there\]  
to pay homage to the stupa.  
The stupa was broken, \[in ruins\],  
covered in grasses, sticks and vines. (2) \[2985\]

I was then a forest-worker,  
as were[^4] father and grandfathers.  
I saw that stupa in the woods,  
broken, tangled in grass and vines. (3) \[2986\]

Having seen the Buddha’s stupa,  
I served \[it\] with a reverent heart:  
“the Best Buddha’s stupa, broken,  
is abandoned in the forest.  
It’s not meet, not appropriate  
for one who can tell right from wrong.[^5]  
\[But\] I engage in other work,  
not cleaning the Buddha’s stupa.” (4-5) \[2987-2988\]  
Cleaning off the grasses and sticks  
and vines \[growing\] on the stupa,  
after worshipping \[it\] eight times,  
\[still\] bent over I \[then\] went off. (6) \[2989\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (7) \[2990\]

There my well-constructed mansion  
was \[made of\] gold, brightly shining.  
It rose up sixty leagues \[in height\]  
\[and it\] was thirty leagues in width. (8) \[2991\]

And thirty \[different\] times did I  
exercise rule over the gods.  
And five and twenty times was I  
a wheel-turning king \[with great strength\]. (9) \[2992\]

Transmigrating from birth to birth,  
I’m receiving great possessions.  
Possessions never lack for me:  
that’s the fruit of cleaning \[stupas\]. (10) \[2993\]

When I’m going in the forest,  
seated on an elephant’s back,[^6]  
whichever direction I go,  
the forest provides \[me\] refuge. (11) \[2994\]

I do not see with \[my two\] eyes  
\[any tree-\]stump or thorn at all.  
In accordance with \[my\] karma,[^7]  
it gets removed all by itself. (12) \[2995\]

I do not get the itch,[^8] ringworm,[^9]  
rashes,[^10] abscesses,[^11] leprosy,[^12]  
epilepsy[^13] \[and\] scabies[^14] \[too\]:  
that’s[^15] the fruit of cleaning \[stupas\]. (13) \[2996\]

Another miracle for me:  
after I had cleaned[^16] the stupa,[^17]  
I was not conscious of pimples  
or spots produced on my body. (14) \[2997\]

Another miracle for me:  
after I had cleaned the stupa,[^18]  
I transmigrate in \[just\] two states:  
that of a god, or of a man. (15) \[2998\]

Another miracle for me:  
after I had cleaned the stupa,[^19]  
every place where I am living  
is gold-colored and very bright. (16) \[2999\]

Another miracle for me:  
after I had cleaned the stupa,[^20]  
displeasing things are avoided,  
\[and\] things which are pleasing appear. (17) \[3000\]

Another miracle for me:  
after I had cleaned the stupa,[^21]  
my mind is \[always very\] pure,  
one-pointed, very attentive. (18) \[3001\]

Another miracle for me:  
after I had cleaned the stupa,[^22]  
seated in a single sitting,  
I achieved the arahant-state. (19) \[3002\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I did that \[good\] karma then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of cleaning \[stupas\]. (20) \[3003\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (21) \[3004\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pabhaṅkara Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pabhaṅkara Thera is finished.

    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.
