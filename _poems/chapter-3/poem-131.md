## Sobhita Chapter, the Fourteenth

### \[131. Sobhita\]

The Victor Padumuttara,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
before a large body of folks  
did preach the path of deathlessness. (1) \[1870\]

\[Then\] having listened to his words,  
those majestic words he uttered,  
pressing both my hands together,  
I became tranquil at that time. (2) \[1871\]

“As the \[great\] ocean is  
the foremost of the seas,  
\[and\] the rock-heap Meru  
is the best of mountains, (3)  
likewise those \[people\] who  
are controlled by the heart  
approach not a tittle  
of the Buddha’s knowledge.” (4) \[1872\][^1]  
The Buddha, Compassionate, Sage,  
setting forth the *Dhamma*-method,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly,  
uttered this verse \[about me then\]: (5) \[1873\]

“He who praises knowledge \[like this\]  
when the Buddha, World-Leader \[lives\],  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
will come to know no bad rebirth. (6) \[1874\]

Having destroyed the defilements,  
tranquil and well-attentive,  
he’ll be the Teacher’s follower,  
known by the name of Sobhita.” (7) \[1875\]

I have burnt up \[my\] defilements,  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
The three-fold knowing is attained,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught. (8) \[1877\][^2]  
In the fifty-thousandth aeon  
there were seven Samuggatas,[^3]  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (9) \[1876\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[1878\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sobhita Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sobhita Thera is finished.

[^1]: PTS presents these lines as two verses with feet of only six syllables each; BJTS presents them (I think correctly) as a single verse whose feet measure twelve syllables each.

[^2]: note that BJTS and PTS invert verses \[1877\] and \[1876\]/(8) and (9). I follow the PTS for consistency even though I suspect BJTS has it right.

[^3]: “Risen Up Together”
