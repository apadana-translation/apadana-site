*\[49. Subhadda\]*  
Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
Great Famed One, lifting up people  
did make them achieve nirvana. (1) \[1215\]

And as the Buddha passed away[^1]  
the ten thousand worlds were quaking.  
A huge group of people and gods  
assembled together \[there\] then. (2) \[1216\]

Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart  
I anointed the Best of Men  
with a covering[^2] that was full  
of incense[^3] and jasmine flowers. (3) \[1217\]

The Teacher, Peerless in the World,  
discerning what I was thinking,  
the Clever One, the Sambuddha  
uttered these verses \[about me\]: (4) \[1218\]

“I shall relate details of him  
who in \[these\], my final moments,  
covered me with scents and flowers;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (5) \[1219\]

Fallen from here this person will  
go to the Tusitā heaven.  
Exercising divine rule there  
he will \[then\] go to Nimmāna.[^4] (6) \[1220\]

\[There\] in that very same way he  
having given superb flowers,  
delighting in his own karma  
will \[then\] enjoy much happiness. (7) \[1221\]

Fallen again this man will be  
born in a Tusitā body.  
Falling from that body \[as well\]  
he will go to a human state. (8) \[1222\]

The Śākyas’ Son, Great Elephant,  
Leader in the world with \[its\] gods  
Eyeful One, awakening, will  
make many achieve nirvana. (9) \[1223\]

Going forth as \[a non-Buddhist,\]  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
approaching the Sambuddha he  
will ask \[good\] questions at that time. (10) \[1224\]

Once he’s spoken, the Sambuddha,  
the Omniscient One, World-Leader,  
discerning his former karma  
will reveal the \[Four Noble\] Truths.[^5] (11) \[1225\]

This one, wise and energetic,  
happy, \[and\] with a tranquil mind,  
after worshipping the Teacher  
will ask to go forth \[a Buddhist\]. (12) \[1226\]

The One Skilled in the Top Teaching,  
he, the Buddha, will \[then\] ordain  
\[this one\] gladdened by own-karma,  
after seeing his \[well\]-pleased mind. (13) \[1227\]

This man, after \[all his\] striving  
in the Buddha’s[^6] dispensation,  
knowing well all the defilements  
will reach nirvana, undefiled.” (14) \[1228\]

The Fifth Recitation Portion.  
In keeping with \[my\] past karma,  
being calm and well-attentive,  
the Buddha’s legitimate son,  
I am well-made, born from *Dhamma*. (15) \[1229\]

Approaching the King of Teaching[^7]  
I asked the ultimate question.  
In addressing my question he  
unloosed the stream of the Teaching. (16) \[1230\]

Understanding his Teaching, I  
lived fond of the dispensation.  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
without defilements I \[now\] live.[]{#BookmarkCopy1 .anchor} (17)
\[1231\]

One hundred thousand aeons hence  
the \[Buddha\] named for a lotus,  
achieved nirvana, beyond grasp,  
like a lamp deprived of \[its\] oil. (18) \[1232\][^8]  
There was a stupa, made of gems,  
\[rising up\] seven leagues \[in height\],  
all-auspicious and delightful;  
there I performed a flag-*pūjā.* (19) \[1233\]

Tissa, the foremost follower  
of the Sambuddha, Kassapa,  
was my \[own\] legitimate son,  
an heir to \[that\] Victor’s teaching. (20) \[1234\]

Because of his immature mind,  
I \[once\] spoke inauspicious words.  
As the result of that \[bad\] deed  
I \[only\] saw the Victor’s death.[^9] (21) \[1235\]

In a garden in a *sal* grove  
the \[Great\] Sage, \[then\] on his death bed,  
the Friend, Compassionate, Victor,  
the Great Hero, ordained me \[there\].[^10] (22) \[1236\]

Today, right now I have gone forth;  
today’s \[my\] ordination too.[^11]  
\[And\] today’s the final passing[^12]  
in front of the Best of Bipeds. (23) \[1237\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (24) \[1238\]

Thus indeed Venerable Subhadda Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Subhadda Thera is finished.
