### \[419. {422.}[^1] Ekadussadāyaka[^2]\]

In the City, Haṃsavatī,  
I was a grass-carrier \[then\].  
I \[earn my\] living hauling grass,  
\[and\] through it I feed \[my\] children. (1) \[4476\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
was the Master of Everything.[^3]  
Doing away with the darkness,  
the World-Leader arose back then. (2) \[4477\]

\[While\] sitting down in \[my\] own house,  
this is what I thought at that time:  
“The Buddha’s risen in the world,  
\[but\] I lack anything to give. (3) \[4478\]

I \[only\] have this single cloak,  
I do not have \[my own\] donor.  
Suffering is a taste of hell;[^4]  
I will \[now\] plant a donation.” (4) \[4479\]

Contemplating \[it\] in this way,  
I brought pleasure to \[my\] own heart.  
Taking that single piece of cloth,  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha. (5) \[4480\]

Having given \[that\] single cloth,  
I gave rise to \[great\] shouts of joy,  
“If you are a Buddha, Wise One,  
carry me across, O Great Sage.” (6) \[4481\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
singing the praises of my gift,  
\[the Buddha\] then gave thanks to me: (7) \[4482\]

“Because of this single cloak\[-gift,\]  
\[done\] with intention and resolve,  
he will not go to a bad place  
for one hundred thousand[^5] aeons. (8) \[4483\]

Thirty-six times a lord of gods,  
he will exercise divine rule.  
And thirty-three times he’ll become  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (9) \[4484\]

There will be much regional rule,  
incalculable by counting.  
In the world of gods or of men,  
you’ll transmigrate in existence. (10) \[4485\]

Good-looking and full of virtue,  
with a body that’s not surpassed,  
you’ll obtain, whenever you wish,  
unwavering limitless cloth.” (11) \[4486\]

When he had said this, the Buddha  
known by the name Supreme Lotus,[^6]  
the Hero[^7] rose into the sky,  
just like a swan-king in the air. (12) \[4487\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
I have no lack of possessions:  
that’s the fruit of a single cloth. (13) \[4488\]

With every footstep \[that I take\],[^8]  
\[some\] cloth is \[then\] produced for me.  
I stand upon cloth underneath;  
a canopy on top of me. (14) \[4489\]

\[And\] today I \[still\] am wishing  
that I could cover with \[some\] cloth  
even the \[whole\] universe  
with \[its\] forests \[and its\] mountains. (15) \[4490\]

Just because of that single cloth,  
transmigrating from birth to birth,  
I was[^9] one of golden color,  
transmigrating from birth to birth.[^10] (16) \[4491\]

\[One\] result of that single cloth:  
no ruination anywhere.[^11]  
This one \[will be my\] final life;  
\[that\] now is bearing fruit for me. (17) \[4492\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave that cloth at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a single cloth. (18) \[4493\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (19) \[4494\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (20) \[4495\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (21) \[4496\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekadussadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekadussadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “One-Cloth-Donor” This same *apadāna* appears as \#{334}, above (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> only), presumably (as I speculate in the notes there) in order to fill a gap in the mss. tradition.

[^3]: lit., “master of all things (*dhamma*)” (or “Master of All Teachings”)

[^4]: *niraya-samphassa*, lit., “contact with hell” “touching of hell” “experience of hell”

[^5]: amending *kappasatahassāni* to *kappasatasahassāni*, which keeps the meter.

[^6]: *jalajuttamanāmaka*

[^7]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> (and <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> alt.) reads *dhīro* (“the wise one”)

[^8]: lit., “footstep after footstep,” or more literally still, “on footstep on footstep,” reduplicated to suggest the whole series. This interpretation follows the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss.

[^9]: lit., “having been”

[^10]: the repetition of the second foot as the fourth foot does not seem to be intentional, as it carries no poetic force and cries out for an indicative verb. I suspect it is a mistake, but an early one as it seems to be in all the manuscript traditions.

[^11]: lit., “not going up into destruction anywhere”
