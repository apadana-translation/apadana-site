*\[233. Sālapupphiya*[^1]*\]*

In Aruṇavatī city

I was a cake-maker[^2] back then.

I saw Sikhi \[Buddha\], Victor,

traveling[^3] through a gate[^4] of mine. (1) \[2432\]

Having taken the Buddha’s bowl

with a mind which was very clear,

I gave a *sal* flower \[to him\],

Buddha, Highest-Point-Attainer. (2) \[2433\]

In the thirty-one aeons since

I donated sweet-meats[^5] to him,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of a *sal* flower. (3) \[2434\]

In the fourteenth aeon ago

I was \[named\] Amitañjala,[^6]

a wheel-turning king with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2435\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2436\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sālapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sālapupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “*Sal-*Flower-er” *Sal,* Pāli *sāla*, is shorea robusta

[^2]: taking *pūvika* from *pūva,* cake (Sinh. *kawum,* oil cakes made
    of sugar and rice flour)

[^3]: lit., “going”

[^4]: or “door,” *dvārena*

[^5]: *khajja,* edible solid food, sweets. This is what one would expect
    the donation from a cake-maker to be, even though the previous verse
    -- and his name -- emphasize *sal* flowers.

[^6]: “Unlimited Salutation,” taking ºañjala from *añjalī*, pressing the
    hands together in reverence.
