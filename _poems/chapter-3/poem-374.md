### \[371. {374.}[^1] Paṭṭipupphiya[^2]\]

When the Sambuddha, the Great Sage,  
Padumuttara passed away,[^3]  
all the people came together;  
they are carrying off \[his\] corpse.[^4] (1) \[3241\]

When the corpse was being removed,  
when the drums were being sounded,[^5]  
happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I offered[^6] \[a\] red lodh flower. (2) \[3242\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I did that flower-*pūjā*,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of worshipping relics.[^7] (3) \[3243\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3244\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[3245\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[3246\]

Thus indeed Venerable Paṭṭipupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Paṭṭipupphiya Thera is finished.
