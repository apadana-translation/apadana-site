*\[288. Sattāhapabbajita*[^1]*\]*

Honored and revered were the monks[^2]

of Vipassi, the Blessed One.

Calamity’d befallen me;[^3]

there was a family rift[^4] at home.[^5] (1) \[2655\]

Entering renunciation

in order to allay \[my\] grief,

I \[spent\] a week there blissfully,

desiring the Teacher’s teaching.[^6] (2) \[2656\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I went forth a renouncer then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

the fruit of renunciation. (3) \[2657\]

In the sixty-seventh aeon

hence, there were seven lords of earth

\[who\] were \[all\] called Sunikkhama,[^7]

wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (4) \[2658\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2659\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sattāhapabbajita Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sattāhapabbajita Thera is finished.
