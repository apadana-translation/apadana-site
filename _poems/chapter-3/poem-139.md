### \[139. Sālapupphadāyaka[^1]\]

I was the king of beasts back then,  
a \[wild\] lion who was fearless.  
While hunting[^2] in a mountain crag,[^3]  
I saw the Leader of the World. (1) \[1928\]

“This one would be the Great Hero;  
he will liberate many folks.[^4]  
Well then oughtn’t I approach the  
God of Gods, the Bull among Men?” (2) \[1929\]

Breaking a branch of a *sal* tree  
I carried \[it\], flowers \[and\] buds.[^5]  
Having approached the Sambuddha,  
I gave \[him\] those superb flowers. (3) \[1930\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I offered those flowers \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of flower-*pūjā*. (4) \[1931\]

And in the ninth aeon ago  
there were three \[different\] kings \[back then\]  
known by the name Virocana,[^6]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (5) \[1932\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1933\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sālapupphadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sālapupphadāyaka Thera is finished.
