### \[34. Kāḷudāyi[^1]\]

Picking a flowering lotus,  
and water lily and jasmine,  
and taking some rice cooked in milk,  
I gave it to the Teacher \[then\],  
to Buddha Padumuttara  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One,  
who had gone out upon the road,  
wandering on journeys back then. (1-2) \[1050-1051\]

\[At that time\] the Great Hero ate  
that milk-rice \[that’s so\] good to eat,  
and taking up that \[lotus\] flower  
he gave it to the people \[there\]. (3) \[1052\]

“This superb lotus is pretty,  
pleasant \[and much\] loved[^2] in the world.  
He who gave this flower to me  
has done a \[most\] difficult deed. (4) \[1053\]

I shall relate details of him  
who offered this flower \[to me\]  
and gave me this rice cooked in milk;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (5) \[1054\]

For ten and also eight more times  
he will exercise divine rule.  
As the result of his karma,[^3]  
\[in the future\] there will be borne  
a canopy built in the sky  
of lily and of lotuses,  
which in addition will contain  
\[the white flowers known as\] jasmine. (6-7) \[1055-1056\]

Five and twenty times he will be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\].  
He will reside upon the earth  
\[and\] have five hundred earthly reigns. (8) \[1057\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (9) \[1058\]

Delighted by his own karma,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
he will be \[the Buddha’s\] kinsman,  
conveying joy to the Śākyans. (10) \[1059\]

And he, having renounced the world,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
will reach nirvana, undefiled. (11) \[1060\]

\[Then\] Gotama, the World’s Kinsman,  
will place \[him\] in a foremost place  
of achieving analysis,  
\[and\] of doing what should be done. (12) \[1061\]

Being one bent on exertion,  
calmed,[^4] devoid of grounds for rebirth,[^5]  
he’ll be the Teacher’s follower;  
his name \[will be\] Udāyi \[then\].” (13) \[1062\]

\[Now\] my heart is liberated;  
ill-will has fallen from the mind.[^6]  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
without defilements I \[now\] live. (14) \[1063\]

An ardent striver, intelligent,  
I satisfied the Sambuddha.  
And the Sambuddha, with delight,  
did place me in that foremost place. (15) \[1064\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (16) \[1065\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kāḷudāyi Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kāḷudāyi Thera is finished.
