*\[124. Gandhodakiya*[^1]*\]*

Sitting in \[my\] superb palace,

I saw the Victor, Vipassi,

splendid like an arjuna tree,[^2]

the Omniscient One, Undefiled. (1) \[1800\]

As the World-Leader went across[^3]

the area near the palace,

his aura spread out \[everywhere\]

as though \[that light came from\] the sun.[^4] (2) \[1801\]

Taking up \[some\] perfumed water

I sprinkled the Best Buddha \[then\],

\[and\] with that pleasure in \[my\] heart,

I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (3) \[1802\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I sprinkled that perfumed water,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[1803\]

In the thirty-first aeon hence

the Kṣatriyan named Sugandha,[^5]

was a wheel-turner with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[1804\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1805\]

Thus indeed Venerable Gandhodakiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Gandhodakiya Thera is finished.
