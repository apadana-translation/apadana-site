*\[204. Taraṇiya*[^1]*\]*  
Atthadassi, the Blessed One,  
the Biped Lord, the Bull of Men,  
honored by his followers \[then\]  
approached the bank of the Ganges. (1) \[2285\]

The Ganges was quite hard to cross  
with even banks full to the brim.[^2]  
I took across the group of monks[^3]  
and the Buddha, Supreme Biped. (2) \[2286\]

In the eighteen-hundredth aeon  
since I did that \[good\] karma then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of ferrying. (3) \[2287\]

In the thirteen-hundredth aeon  
there were five \[named\] Sabhogava,[^4]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength,  
possessors of the seven gems. (4) \[2288\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2289\]

Thus indeed Venerable Taraṇiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Taraṇiya Thera is finished.
