*\[473. {476.}*[^1] *Kusaṭṭhakadāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
Happy, with pleasure in my heart,  
I gave eight tickets for alms food[^3]  
to Kassapa, the Blessed One,  
the Brahmin, the Perfected One.[^4] (1) \[4991\]

Within the \[present\] aeon, since  
I gave those eight meal-tickets \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of eight meal-tickets. (2) \[4992\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4993\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4994\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4995\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kusaṭṭhakadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kusaṭṭhakadāyaka Thera is finished.

    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Eight Meal Ticket-er”  
[^3]: *kusa* \[Skt. *kuśa,* i.e. a type of sharp grass\] + *aṭṭhaka*,
    “an octave” “eight in number”. Cone explains this very passage as
    “(food) for eight tickets,” following Cty (p. 487: “the meaning is:
    ‘I gave eight meals-by-ticket \[*aṭṭha-salākaka-bhattaṃ*\] which are
    to be given on the basis of blades of *kusa* \[grass, the actual
    “tickets” or “markers”\] for \[types of\] meals-by-ticket
    \[including\] “meals within a fortnight” \[*pakkhika-bhattaº*\],
    “meals on lunar sabbaths” \[*uposathikabhatta*\], “regular meals”
    \[*dhura-bhatta*\], etc.’”), as does BJTS Sinhala gloss (*lahabat
    aṭak*). However, unlike BJTS and cty, Cone’s translation could be
    read to mean that the gift was of food for eight tickets; I suggest,
    conversely, that the gift was of eight tickets for food. In other
    words, the presentation of the blades of *kusa* grass was an
    invitation to eight different meals.
