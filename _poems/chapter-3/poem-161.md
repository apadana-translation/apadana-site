## Supāri<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ariya Chapter, the Seventeenth

### \[161. Supāri<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ariya[^1]\]

The one whose name was Paduma,  
the Bull of Men, the Biped-Lord,  
Eyeful One, setting out from the  
forest, was \[then\] preaching *Dhamma*. (1) \[2050\]

There was a spirit[^2]-multitude  
\[staying\] close to the Sage so Great.  
Whatever work they’d arrived for  
they looked after all of the time. (2) \[2051\]

Understanding the Buddha’s words  
and preaching of the deathless \[state\],  
with a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind,  
snapping \[my\] fingers I served \[him\]. (3) \[2052\]

Look at the fruit of good practice,  
of service for the \[great\] Teacher:  
in thirty thousand aeons \[thence,\]  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth. (4) \[2053\]

In the twenty-nine-hundredth aeon,  
one \[man\] named Samalaṅkata,[^3]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[2054\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2055\]

Thus indeed Venerable Supāri<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ariya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Supāri<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ariya Thera is finished.
