*\[500. {503.}*[^1] *Kāsumāriphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*

I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,

the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,

sitting down on a mountainside,

shining like a dinner-plate tree.[^3] (1) \[5408\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,

hands pressed together on \[my\] head,

gathering *kāsumāri*[^4] fruit,

I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha. (2) \[5409\]

In the thirty-one aeons since

I gave that fruit \[to the Buddha\],

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[5410\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;

all \[new\] existence is destroyed.

Like elephants with broken chains,

I am living without constraint. (4) \[5411\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence

was a very good thing for me.

The three knowledges are attained;

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5412\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5413\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kāsumāriphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kāsumāriphaladāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Kāsumāri (Sinh. *ät dämaṭa*) Fruit Donor” The same *apadāna,*
    with the same name, appears verbatim as \#377 {380} above, with the
    slight difference that the first and second verses of the standard
    three-verse concluding refrain are inverted (second first, first
    second)

[^3]: *kaṇṇikāra, kaṇikāra* = Sinhala *kinihiriya*, Pterospermum
    acerifolium, produces a brilliant mass of yellow flowers; Engl.
    a.k.a. karnikar, bayur tree, maple-leaf bayur, caniyar (now
    archaic?), dinner-plate tree; Bodhi tree of Siddhattha Buddha.

[^4]: *kāsumārī* (Skt. *kāśmarī*) is a small timber tree, Gmelina
    arborea *(Verb.)*, which is called *ǟt demaṭa* in Sinhala. It also
    bears yellow flowers.
