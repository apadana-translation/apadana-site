*\[165. Kaṇikāracchadaniya*[^1]*\]*  
The Sambuddha named Vessabhu,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
the Sage entered a great forest  
to take a rest one afternoon. (1) \[2072\]

Having plucked dinner-plate flower\[s\]  
I made \[him\] a canopy then.  
Making that floral canopy,  
I gifted it to the Buddha. (2) \[2073\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I offered \[those\] flower\[s\] \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2074\]

In the twentieth aeon hence  
there were eight kings[^2] \[named\] Soṇṇābha,  
wheel-turners who had great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (4) \[2075\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2076\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kaṇikāracchadaniya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kaṇikāracchadaniya Thera is finished.
