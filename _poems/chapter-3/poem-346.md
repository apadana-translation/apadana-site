*\[343. {346.}*[^1] *Campakapupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named Cāvala.[^3]  
The Buddha named Sudassana  
was living on the mountainside. (1) \[3112\]

Taking Himalayan flowers,  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
the Flood-Crosser,[^4] the Undefiled,[^5]  
traveling through the sky \[just then\]. (2) \[3113\]

At that time I placed on \[his\] head  
seven \[fragrant\] *campaka* blooms.  
I offered \[them\] to the Buddha,  
the Self-Become One, the Great Sage. (3) \[3114\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] those flowers,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (4) \[3115\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[3116\]

Thus indeed Venerable Campakapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Campakapupphiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “C*ampaka*-Flower-er”. The *campaka* (Sinh. *sapu*) tree is
    *Magnolia champaca,* formerly classified as *michelia champaca*.
    English names for the tree include Champak, Joy Perfume Tree, Yellow
    Jade Orchid Tree and Fragrant Himalayan Champaca. It was the Bodhi
    tree of the seventeenth Buddha of the *Buddhavaṃsa*, Atthadassi. It
    has highly fragrant cream to yellowish-colored blossoms.
