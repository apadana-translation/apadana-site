### \[343. {346.}[^1] <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>ampakapupphiya[^2]\]

In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>āvala.[^3]  
The Buddha named Sudassana  
was living on the mountainside. (1) \[3112\]

Taking Himalayan flowers,  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
the Flood-Crosser,[^4] the Undefiled,[^5]  
traveling through the sky \[just then\]. (2) \[3113\]

At that time I placed on \[his\] head  
seven \[fragrant\] *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampaka* blooms.  
I offered \[them\] to the Buddha,  
the Self-Become One, the Great Sage. (3) \[3114\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] those flowers,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (4) \[3115\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[3116\]

Thus indeed Venerable <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>ampakapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>ampakapupphiya Thera is finished.

English names for the tree include Champak, Joy Perfume Tree, Yellow Jade Orchid Tree and Fragrant Himalayan Champaca. It was the Bodhi tree of the seventeenth Buddha of the *Buddhavaṃsa*, Atthadassi. It has highly fragrant cream to yellowish-colored blossoms.
