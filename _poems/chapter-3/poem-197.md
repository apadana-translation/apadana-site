*\[197. Tindukadāyaka*[^1]*\]*

Traveling a bad mountain road,

I was a monkey,[^2] strong and fast.

Seeing wild mangosteen[^3] in fruit,

I called to mind the Best Buddha. (1) \[2248\]

Going forth[^4] for several days,

cheerful, with pleasure in \[my\] heart

I sought the Leader of the World,

Siddhattha, the Three-Worlds-Ender.[^5] (2) \[2249\]

Realizing that thought of mine,

the Teacher, Supreme in the World,

came into my vicinity

with one thousand free of outflows.[^6] (3) \[2250\]

Generating great delight[^7] \[then,\]

I approached \[him\] with fruit in hand.

The Blessed One accepted \[it\],

the Omniscient, Best Debater. (4) \[2251\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I gave \[him that\] fruit at that time,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of a gift of fruit. (5) \[2252\]

In the fifty-seventh aeon

\[there was one\] named Upananda,[^8]

a wheel-turning king with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (6) \[2253\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[2254\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tindukadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tindukadāyaka Thera is finished.
