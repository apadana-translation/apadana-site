## Jagatidāyaka Chapter, the Forty-Sixth

### \[448. {451.}[^1] Jagatidāyaka[^2]\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I had the spot of earth[^3] cleared for  
the foot of the superb Bodhi[^4]  
of Dhammadassi \[Buddha\], Sage. (1) \[4797\]

From a cliff or from a mountain,  
\[when\] I have fallen from a tree,  
I get support \[to break\] the fall:  
that’s the fruit of a spot of earth. (2) \[4798\]

Thieves are not harassing me \[and\]  
rulers[^5] don’t despise me \[either\];  
I am surpassing all my friends:  
that’s the fruit of a spot of earth. (3) \[4799\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
everywhere I’m being worshipped:[^6]  
that’s the fruit of a spot of earth. (4) \[4800\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
\[since\] I prepared that spot of earth,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a spot of earth. (5) \[4801\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (6) \[4802\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4803\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[4804\]

Thus indeed Venerable Jagatidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Jagatidāyaka Thera is finished.
