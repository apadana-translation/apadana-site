### {\*333, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> only: Punnāgapupphiya[^1]}

Plunging into a forest grove,  
I \[lived there as\] a hunter \[then\].  
Seeing a laurel tree[^2] in bloom,  
I called to mind the Best Buddha. \[2944\]

Having plucked a flower \[from it,\]  
well-perfumed \[and\] scented with scents,  
having made a stupa of sand,[^3]  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha. \[2945\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did that flower-*pūjā* \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. \[2946\]

In the ninety-first aeon \[hence\]  
lived \[a ruler\], Tamonuda,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. \[2947\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[2948\]

Thus indeed Venerable Punnāgapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Punnāgapupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Punnāga*-Flower-er,” *punnāga* being a type of flowering tree (Sinhala *domba*), Alexandrian laurel. Like the previous one, this *apadāna* already has been given verbatim above, as \#159 \[vv. 2038-2042\], apparently being supplied again here to fulfill the colophonic expectation of an *apadāna* so-named at this juncture in the text

[^2]: *punnāga*

[^3]: lit., “in sand”

[^4]: = *tama* (darkness) plus *ūna-da* (less, reduced)?
