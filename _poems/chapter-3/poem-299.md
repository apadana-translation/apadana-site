*\[299. Ambapiṇḍiya\]*  
I was a famous titan[^1] \[then,\]  
known by the name of Romasa.[^2]  
I gave \[some\] mangoes as alms food  
to Vipassi \[Buddha\], Great Sage. (1) \[2710\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] those mangoes back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving mangoes. (2) \[2711\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2712\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Ambapiṇḍiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ambapiṇḍiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: Dānava = a kind of Asura  
[^2]: a recurrent name in *Apadāna,* of uncertain meaning
