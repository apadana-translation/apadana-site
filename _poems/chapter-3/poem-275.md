*\[275. Ekañjaliya*[^1]*\]*  
I gave an open dwelling place  
to the Recluse, the Greatest Sage,  
dwelling in \[the shade of\] a fig[^2]  
on a \[well-\]prepared[^3] mat of leaves. (1) \[2600\]  
Raising my hands pressed together,[^4]  
I spread out a mat of flowers  
for Tissa, the Best of Bipeds,  
Lord of the World, the Neutral One. (2) \[2601\]  
In the ninety-two aeons since  
I fashioned that mat of flowers,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] a mat. (3) \[2602\]  
In the fourteenth aeon ago  
I was a ruler of people,[^5]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
known as[^6] Eka-añjalika.[^7] (4) \[2603\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2604\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Ekañjaliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ekañjaliya Thera is finished.
