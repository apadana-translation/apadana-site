*\[272. Tilamuṭṭhidāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
Discerning what I was thinking,  
the Teacher, the World’s Chief Leader,  
by means of his body made of  
mind approached me through his powers.[^2] (1) \[2586\]

While attending on the Teacher,  
worshipping the Supreme Person,  
happy, with pleasure in my heart,  
I gave a sesame-handful. (2) \[2587\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave a sesame-handful,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
a handful of sesame’s fruit. (3) \[2588\]

In the sixteenth aeon ago  
the *kṣatriyan* named Nandiya  
was a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2589\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2590\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tilamuṭṭhidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Tilamuṭṭhidāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Sesame-handful Donor”
