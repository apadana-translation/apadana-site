### \[450. {453.}[^1] Sīhāsanavījanīya[^2]\]

I worshipped the Bodhi tree of  
Tissa \[Buddha\], the Blessed One.  
Having taken up a fan there,  
I fanned the \[Bodhi’s\] lion-throne. (1) \[4813\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I fanned that lion-throne back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of fanning \[it\]. (2) \[4814\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[4815\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[4816\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[4817\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sīhāsanavījanīya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sīhāsanavījanīya Thera is finished.
