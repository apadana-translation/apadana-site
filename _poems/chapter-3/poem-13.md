### \[13. Nanda\]

Padumuttara’s *khoma* cloth[^1]  
I gave to the Self-Become One,  
the Sage So Great, the Blessed One,  
the Best in the World, Neutral One. (1) \[700\]

Then Buddha, named for the lotus[^2]  
made this prophesy about me:  
“due to giving this piece of cloth  
you will have the color of gold. (2) \[701\]

Experiencing two-fold bliss[^3]  
incited by \[your\] wholesome roots  
you will be the younger brother  
of Gotama the Blessed One. (3) \[702\]

Happy by nature but lustful,  
\[you\] will be greedy for pleasures.  
Being incited by Buddha  
you will then go forth, renouncing. (4) \[703\]

After you’ve renounced the world there,  
incited by \[your\] wholesome roots,  
knowing well all the defilements.  
you’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (5) \[704\]

In the seven-thousandth[^4] aeon  
there were four with the name <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>ela;[^5]  
sixty thousand aeons \[ago\]  
there were four named Upa<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ela;[^6] (6) \[705\]

in the five-thousandth aeon ago  
there were four people \[named\] <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>ela;  
they were rulers of the four continents  
possessors of the seven gems. (7) \[706\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[707\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nanda Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Nanda Thera is finished.
