### \[319. Kandalīpupphiya[^1]\]

I was a farmer at that time  
on the banks of River Indus.  
Bound in service to another,  
I looked not for that other’s rice.[^2] (1) \[2814\]

Wandering along the Indus,  
I saw Siddhattha, the Victor,  
sitting down in meditation[^3]  
like a lotus flower in bloom. (2) \[2815\]

I having cut off \[all\] the stems  
of seven plantain flowers \[then\],  
did spread them out upon the head  
of Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun. (3) \[2816\]

Attentive to the protocol,  
\[back then\] after I had approached  
the Golden-Colored Sambuddha,  
Wise One, With Senses Well-Controlled,  
-- Hard to Approach like a tusker,  
a *mātaṇga* in three-fold rut —  
having pressed my hands together  
I worshipped \[Buddha\], the Teacher. (4-5) \[2817-2818\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (6) \[2819\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[2820\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kandalīpupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kandalīpupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “*Kandalī*-Flower-er.” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> takes *kandalī* as *kadalī*, plantain, which has other witness in the tradition (cf. Cone, sv) and which is specified in v. 3. Hence, “Plantain-Flower-er”.

[^2]: i.e., I was self-sufficient, I earned my own keep. This follows the reading of <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss.

[^3]: lit., “seated with *samādhi*
