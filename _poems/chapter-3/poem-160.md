### \[160. Kumudadāyaka[^1]\]

Close to the Himalayan range,  
there was a large, natural lake  
covered with pink and blue lotuses,  
with white lotuses strewn about.[^2] (1) \[2043\]

At that time I was a bird there,  
known by the name of Kakudha,[^3]  
learned in merit/not merit,[^4]  
moral and intelligent \[too\]. (2) \[2044\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the Great Sage wandered into the  
vicinity of that \[great\] lake. (3) \[2045\]

Taking a water-born lotus,  
I gave it to the Great Sage \[then\].  
Discerning what I was thinking,  
the Sage so Great accepted \[it\]. (4) \[2046\]

After having given that gift,  
incited by \[my\] wholesome roots,  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth. (5) \[2047\]

In the sixteen-hundredth aeon  
there were people, \[numbering\] eight,  
\[all of whom\] were named Varuṇa,  
wheel-turning kings with great power. (6) \[2048\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[2049\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kumudadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kumudadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “White-Lotus-Donor”

[^2]: the three types of lotus here are, respectively, the pinkish or red *paduma* (Sinhala *piyum*), the blueish or purple *uppala* (Sinhala *upul*, *neḷum*, *nil mānel*) and the *puṇḍarīka*, or white lotus, identical to the *kumuda* in his name, which is the type of flower he gives to Padumuttara Buddha in v. \[2046\]..

[^3]: “arjuna Tree”. *Kakudha* (a.k.a. *ajjuṇa*, Sinhala *kumbuk gasa*, *terminalia arjuna*) is an impressively large, shade-giving tree that grows near tanks and lakes. Crataeva Hygrophyla

[^4]: that is, learned (clever, wise) at distinguishing what is meritorious from what is not (according to the cty: what is *kusala* or wholesome from what is *akusala*, not wholesome).
