### \[314. Sattapadumiya[^1]\]

I was a brahmin, Nesāda,[^2]  
dwelling on a riverbank \[then\].  
I swept out the hermitage \[there,\]  
with lotus flowers \[as my broom\]. (1) \[2781\]

Seeing the Golden Sambuddha,  
Siddhattha, Leader of the World,  
traveling through the forest \[once\]  
I felt a feeling of delight.[^3] (2) \[2782\]

Going to meet the Sambuddha,  
Siddhattha, Leader of the World,  
I brought him to the hermitage  
and spread lotuses and lilies.[^4] (3) \[2783\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (4) \[2784\]

In the seventh aeon ago  
there were four Pādapāvaras,[^5]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength,  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[2785\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2786\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sattapadumiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sattapadumiya Thera is finished.
