### \[396. {399.}[^1] Sabbadāyaka[^2]\]

Floating in[^3] the great ocean, my  
palace \[then\] was very well-made.  
There was a pond, \[also\] well made,  
\[full of\] the cries of ruddy geese,[^4] (1) \[3828\]

covered with *mandālaka*[^5] blooms  
and with pink and blue lotuses.  
And a river was flowing there,  
beautiful, with excellent banks, (2) \[3829\]

covered with fish and tortoises,[^6]  
with various birds[^7] spread about,[^8]  
noisy with peacocks[^9] \[and\] herons,[^10]  
\[and\] the \[calls of birds\] like cuckoos.[^11] (3) \[3830\]

Pigeons[^12] \[and\] *ravi*-swans[^13] \[as well\],  
ruddy geese[^14] and *nadī<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>aras*,  
lapwings[^15] \[and\] mynah birds[^16] are here,  
small monkeys,[^17] *jīvajīvakas*.[^18] (4) \[3831\]

\[It\] resounds with swans and herons,  
owls and many *piṅgalas*.  
The sand contains the seven gems,  
\[strewn with\] jewels \[and costly\] pearls. (5) \[3832\]

All of the trees, made out[^19] of gold,  
pervaded by various scents,  
are lighting up my palace \[there\],  
by day and night, all of the time. (6) \[3833\]

Sixty thousand instruments are  
being played morning and evening.  
Sixteen thousand women \[as well\]  
are waiting on me constantly. (7) \[3834\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
having departed \[my\] palace,  
I worshipped that Greatly Famed One,  
Sumedha, Leader of the World. (8) \[3835\]

Having greeted the Sambuddha,  
inviting him \[and\] Assembly,[^20]  
that Wise One[^21] then agreed \[to come\],  
Sumedha, Leader of the World. (9) \[3836\]

Having preached the *Dhamma* to me,[^22]  
the Great Sage \[later\] took his leave.  
Having greeted the Sambuddha,  
I returned to my palace \[then\]. (10) \[3837\]

I summoned \[all\] the people[^23] there:  
“All of you gather together.  
In the first part of the day,  
the Buddha will come to the palace.” (11) \[3838\]

“We dwelling near you[^24] have received  
something that’s well-gotten for us.  
We too will do a *pūjā* for  
the Teacher, the Best of Buddhas.” (12) \[3839\]

After putting up food \[and\] drink,  
I announced that it was the time.  
The Leader of the World arrived  
with one hundred thousand masters.[^25] (13) \[3840\]

I went to meet[^26] \[him\] with the five[^27]  
musical instruments \[sounding\].  
The Supreme Person[^28] sat down on  
a chair made out of solid gold.[^29] (14) \[3841\]

I placed[^30] a canopy[^31] above,  
which was made out of solid gold;[^32]  
Fans are then diffusing \[perfumes\][^33]  
within the Assembly of monks. (15) \[3842\]

I regaled the monks’ Assembly  
with large amounts of food \[and\] drink;  
I gave individual pairs  
of cloth[^34] to the monks’ Assembly. (16) \[3843\]

The one whom they called Sumedha,  
Object of the World’s Oblations,[^35]  
sitting in the monks’ Assembly,  
spoke these \[six\] verses \[at that time\]: (17) \[3844\]

“This one who \[gave\] me food and drink  
and fed[^36] the Assembly with it,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (18) \[3845\]

For eighteen hundred aeons he  
will delight in the world of gods.  
A thousand times he’ll be a king,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (19) \[3846\]

In whichever womb he’s reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
a canopy of solid gold  
will always[^37] be carried \[for him\]. (20) \[3847\]

In thirty thousand aeons \[hence\],  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (21) \[3848\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled. (22) \[3849\]

Sitting in the monks’ Assembly,  
he will \[then\] roar the lion’s roar.[^38]  
On \[his\] pyre an umbrella’s borne;[^39]  
beneath it[^40] he is cremated.” (23) \[3850\]

Monkhood has been attained by me;  
my defilements are \[now\] burnt up.  
In a pavilion or tree-root,  
burning heat is not known by me. (24) \[3851\]

In the thirty thousand aeons  
since I gave that gift at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of giving everything. (25) \[3852\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
All defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (26) \[3853\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (27) \[3854\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (28) \[3855\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sabbadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sabbadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Everything Donor.” This same *apadāna* is repeated below as \#{551} (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> only), ascribed there to Yasa Thera, with the slight difference that the first verse of the concluding refrain there follows the more typical pattern “Like elephants…”

[^3]: *ogayha*, “submerged in” “plunged into.” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> normalizes this by glossing “in the vicinity of the great ocean,” but I take it more literally, and assume that the protagonist is a supernatural being for whom this *is* normal.

[^5]: RD says this is a water-plant, a kind of lotus, referencing J iv.539; vi.47, 279, 564. No <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss here. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss at \[324\] is “a water-born plant named *Mandālā*”. At \[171\] <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinh. gloss is *taḍāgayangen*, “from the moss,” following its reading of \[170\] “well fixed \[in the mosses\]”. Bot. Dict. *taḍāga* = *sevela*. At \[4231\], \[4233\], \[4313\], \[6332\] the (or a) <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss is *helmällen*, *heḷmäli* = edible white water-lily, Nymphaea Lotus.

[^17]: *pampakā*, Sinh. gloss *huṇapupulō* (Sorata = *uṇahapuḷuvā*), a small, tailless monkey. Its high-pitched cry, which famously (and frighteningly) resembles that of a cobra, is apparently the reason these have been included in the present list of (mostly) birds known for their cries.
