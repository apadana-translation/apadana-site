*\[440. {443.}*[^1] *Billaphaliya*[^2]*\]*  
On Candabhāgā River’s bank,  
my well-constructed hermitage  
was served by varied \[types\] of trees,  
\[and\] strewn with *bel* trees \[full of fruit.\] (1) \[4731\]  
Seeing a fragrant *bel* tree,[^3] I,  
remembering the Best Buddha,  
having filled up a *khāri* load,  
thrilled, mind \[stirred up\] with emotion,  
having approached Kakusandha,  
with a mind that was very clear,  
I gave \[that\] *bel* fruit \[I had brought\]  
to \[him,\] the Hero, Merit-Field. (2-3) \[4732-4733\]  
Within the \[present\] aeon, since  
I gave that fruit \[to him\] back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (4) \[4734\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[4735\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4736\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4737\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Billaphaliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Billaphaliya Thera is finished.
