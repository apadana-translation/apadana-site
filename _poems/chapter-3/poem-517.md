*\[514. {517.}*[^1] *Kuṭajapupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named Cāvala.[^3]  
The Buddha named Sudassana  
was living on the mountainside. (1) \[5493\]  
Taking Himalayan flowers,  
I traveled through the sky \[back then\].  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
the Flood-Crosser,[^4] the Undefiled.[^5] (2) \[5494\]  
Taking a winter-cherry bloom,  
I placed it on \[his\] head \[just\] then.  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha,  
the Self-Become One, the Great Sage. (3) \[5495\]  
In the thirty-one aeons since  
I offered[^6] \[him\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (4) \[5496\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[5497\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5498\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[5499\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Kuṭajapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kuṭajapupphiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Arctic-Snow-Flower-er”. Sinhala *keḷinda*, aka Arctic Snow,
    Winter Cherry, nerium antidysenterica, as its name implies used for
    dysentery. See above, \#181, for a different *apadāna* ascribed to a
    monk of the same name. Cf. also \#343 {346}, above, for a very
    similar *apadāna* ascribed to a monk of a different name.  
[^3]: perhaps “Falling Away” or “Disappearing,” from *cavati.* Also
    appears in v. 1 of \#343 {346}, above.
