### \[44. Sannidhāpaka[^1]\]

Building a hut in the forest,  
I dwelt upon a mountain \[then\],  
I was happy to get, or not,  
in glory as in dishonor.[^2] (1) \[1184\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
with a hundred thousand masters[^3]  
came into my presence \[back then\]. (2) \[1185\]

Laying out a mat made of grass  
for the one named for the lotus,  
the Great Hero, who had arrived,  
\[and\] I gave \[it\] to \[him,\] the Teacher. (3) \[1186\]

Happy, and with a happy heart,  
with a mind that was very clear,  
I provided \[both\] food[^4] and drink  
to him, the Upright \[Sambuddha\]. (4) \[1187\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave \[him\] that gift back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of castor oil fruit.[^5] (5) \[1188\]

In the forty-first aeon hence  
I was known as Arindama,[^6]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (6) \[1189\][^7]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1190\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sannidhāpaka[^8] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sannidhāpaka[^9] Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Putter-Down;” BJTS, cty read *Sanniṭṭhāpaka*, “Readier” “Preparer”

[^2]: *yasena ayasena ca*, lit., "with glory as with dishonor”

[^3]: lit “with a hundred thousand who had the power to subdue others (*vasī*),” namely arahants

[^4]: *āmaṇḍaṃ*, which PSI defines as “a kind of plant, *Palma Christi*,” Sinhala *eraṇḍu*. The latter (also *ēraṇḍu*, Pāli *eraṇḍa*) = *datti*, croton, i.e., (see Cone, s.v.) the castor oil plant (Ricinus communis, the seeds of which are used to make an oil). BJTS gloss on this verse gives *kaekiri*, which is something like a cucumber (genera Cucumis), which I suspect is wrong, but the main point is clear, that the hermit gave the Buddha something to eat, presumably whatever fruit he himself was used to eating.

[^5]: see previous note; some kind of food, BJTS gloss is *käkiri*

[^6]: “Enemy-Tamer”

[^7]: text misreads as \[1789\]

[^8]: BJTS reads *Sanniṭṭhāpaka*

[^9]: BJTS reads *Sanniṭṭhāpaka*
