### \[328. Sumanāveliya[^1]\]

All the people, come together,  
were doing a great *pūjā* for  
Vessabhu \[Buddha\], Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One. (1) \[2888\]

Making a ball of pure alms food  
\[and\], happy, a floral garland,  
I then offered \[them\] in front of  
the lion-throne of the Buddha. (2) \[2889\]

All the people, come together,  
are seeing that superb flower.  
“By whom was this flower offered[^2]  
to the Best Buddha, Neutral One?” (3) \[2890\]

Because of that mental pleasure,  
I was reborn in Nimmāna.[^3]  
I experience own-karma,  
done well in the past by myself. (4) \[2891\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
I am dear to all the \[people\]:  
that’s the fruit of flower-*pūjā*. (5) \[2892\]

I’ve come to know no reviling[^4]  
of self-controlled ascetics done  
by me by means of \[my\] body,  
nor[^5] with \[my\] speech \[nor\] through my mind. (6) \[2893\]

Because of that good behavior  
\[and my\] mental resolution,[^6]  
I am honored[^7] by all \[people\]:  
that’s the fruit of not reviling. (7) \[2894\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that flower-*pūjā* \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (8) \[2895\]

In the eleventh aeon hence  
there was a king,[^8] Sahassāra,[^9]  
wheel-turning monarch with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (9) \[2896\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[2897\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sumanāveliya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sumanāveliya Thera is finished.
