*\[179. Tikicchaka*[^1]*\]*  
In the city, Bandhumatī,  
I was a well-trained physician,  
bringing many folks happiness  
when patients suffered great \[illness\]. (1) \[2142\]  
Having seen a monk who was sick,  
\[but\] moral \[as too\] very bright,  
with a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind,  
I gave \[him some\] medicine then. (2) \[2143\]  
That monk with well-guarded senses  
became healthy because of that.  
He was Vipassi’s attendant,  
known by the name of Asoka.[^2] (3) \[2144\]  
In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] medicinal herbs,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of medicine. (4) \[2145\]  
In the eighth aeon after that  
the one known as Sabbosadha[^3]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[2146\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2147\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Tikicchaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Tikicchaka Thera is finished.
