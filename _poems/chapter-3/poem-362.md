### \[359. {362.}[^1] Kekkhārupupphiya[^2]\]

Coming from the world of the dead,[^3]  
\[I saw\] Gotama, Splendid One.[^4]  
Taking a *kekkhāra* flower  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha. (1) \[3184\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did *pūjā* to the Buddha,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (2) \[3185\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3186\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kekkhārupupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kekkhārupupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “*Kekkhāra* Flower-er.” Here the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reading *Kakkāru°* is to be preferred. According to RD, *kakkāru* is the pumpkin gourd, Beninkasa Cerifera; <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> glosses *käkiri mal*, “cucumber flowers.” *Kakkāru* is also the name of a heavenly flower, which given the context is probably the intention here. As a result I leave the term untranslated, and given that, have retained the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> (mis)spelling of the term.

[^3]: *yāmā devā*, a class of deities, perhaps derived from God Yama (the Lord of the Dead).

[^4]: *siri-va<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chasaŋ*. Taking *va<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chasaŋ* as *va<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">cc</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">chch</span>asaṃ* (“splendor”) the literal meaning would be a more emphattic, “He of Resplendent Splendor”
