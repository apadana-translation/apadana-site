*\[359. {362.}*[^1] *Kekkhārupupphiya*[^2]*\]*  
Coming from the world of the dead,[^3]  
\[I saw\] Gotama, Splendid One.[^4]  
Taking a *kekkhāra* flower  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha. (1) \[3184\]  
In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did *pūjā* to the Buddha,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (2) \[3185\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3186\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Kekkhārupupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kekkhārupupphiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “*Kekkhāra* Flower-er.” Here the BJTS reading *Kakkāruº* is to be
    preferred. According to RD, *kakkāru* is the pumpkin gourd,
    Beninkasa Cerifera; BJTS glosses *käkiri mal,* “cucumber flowers.”
    *Kakkāru* is also the name of a heavenly flower, which given the
    context is probably the intention here. As a result I leave the term
    untranslated, and given that, have retained the PTS (mis)spelling of
    the term.  
[^3]: *yāmā devā,* a class of deities, perhaps derived from God Yama
    (the Lord of the Dead).  
[^4]: *siri-vacchasaŋ*. Taking *vacchasaŋ* as *vaccasaṃ* (“splendor”)
    the literal meaning would be a more emphattic, “He of Resplendent
    Splendor”
