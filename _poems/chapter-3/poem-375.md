### \[372. {375.}[^1] Sattapaṇṇiya[^2]\]

The Sambuddha named Sumana  
was born, the Leader of the World.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I offered[^3] *ruk-attana* blooms. (1) \[3247\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I offered[^4] *ruk-attana*,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
fruit of *ruk-attana-pūjā*. (2) \[3248\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3249\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[3250\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[3251\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sattapaṇṇiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sattapaṇṇiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “*Ruk-attana*-\[Flower\]-er”. I follow BJTS in reading *sattapaṇṇi* (lit., “hundred-leaved”) as the *ruk-attana* tree, Alstonia scholaris (*Apocyn.*). RD just identifies it as a tree.
