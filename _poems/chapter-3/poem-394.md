### \[391. {394.}[^1] Madhudāyaka[^2]\]

I had a well-made hermitage,  
on the banks of River Indus.  
There[^3] I am instructing students  
in history and \[reading\] signs. (1) \[3706\]

They lived on the Indus’ slopes,  
desiring teachings,[^4] learned folks,[^5]  
masters in Vedic sciences,[^6]  
wanting to hear good instruction.[^7] (2) \[3707\]

They were skilled in interpreting[^8]  
omens as well as \[reading\] signs.[^9]  
Searching for ultimate meaning,  
they then dwelt within the forest. (3) \[3708\]

The Sambuddha named Sumedha  
arose in the world at that time.  
Being \[filled\] with pity for us,  
the \[Buddha, the\] Guide,[^10] approached \[us\]. (4) \[3709\]

Fashioning a mat out of grass[^11]  
for Sumedha, the World’s Leader,  
the Great Hero who had approached,  
I gave \[it\] to the World’s Best One. (5) \[3710\]

Taking honey from the forest,  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha.  
The Sambuddha, having consumed  
\[it\], spoke these words \[to us back then\]: (6) \[3711\]

“He who gave this honey to me,  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[his\] own hands,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (7) \[3712\]

Because of this honey-giving,  
and because of the mat of grass,  
for thirty thousand aeons he  
will delight in the world of gods. (8) \[3713\]

\[After\] thirty thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (9) \[3714\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (10) \[3715\]

Coming here from the world of gods,  
\[when I\] approached \[my\] mother’s womb,  
there then rained a rain of honey;[^12]  
the earth was covered with honey.[^13] (11) \[3716\]

When I was coming out from the  
womb, as though very unhappily,[^14]  
there again a rain of honey  
is raining for me constantly. (12) \[3717\]

Having departed from the house,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
I am receiving[^15] food \[and\] drink:  
that’s the fruit of giving honey. (13) \[3718\]

\[Whether\] born human \[or\] divine,  
I succeed in all \[my\] wishes.  
Just because of that honey-gift,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.[^16] (14) \[3719\]

When the god is raining, I am always living  
undefiled \[and\] happy, on grass four fingers \[high\],  
or[^17] covered[^18] by a tree \[bursting forth\] in full bloom,[^19]  
in an empty house, a pavilion, \[or\] tree root.[^20] (15-16) \[3720\][^21]

I’ve overcome all existence,  
great \[or\] small \[or\] in the middle.[^22]  
Today I’m free of defilements;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (17) \[3721\]

In the thirty thousand aeons  
since I gave that gift at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving honey. (18) \[3722\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
All defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (19) \[3723\]

My being in Buddha’s presence[^23]  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (20) \[3724\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (21) \[3725\]

Thus indeed Venerable Madhudāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Madhudāyaka Thera is finished.

[^2]: “Honey Donor”

[^3]: reading *tattha* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *tassa*, “his”

[^4]: *dhammakāmā*. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss just gives *dharmakāmī*. I do not capitalize “teachings” because I assume the term is used more generically to mean doctrines, rather than *the* Dhamma.

[^5]: *vinītā*

[^6]: *chalaṅge*, lit., “six branches” of Vedic science. RD, S.V.: “the set of six Vedāngas, disciplines of Vedic science, viz. 1. kappa, 2. vyākaraṇā, 3. nirutti, 4. sikkhā, 5. chando (vi<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>iti), 6. joti-sattha (thus enumd at VvA 265; at PvA 97 in sequence 4, 1, 3, 2, 6, 5): D iii.269; Vv 6316; Pv ii.613; Miln 178, 236.”

[^7]: reading *susāsanaṃ sotukāmā* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *sotukāmā pi sāsanaŋ*, “also wanting to hear instructions.” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss gives *anuśāsanaya asanu kämättā*, “desiring to listen to instructions,” and I follow suit in the generic translation here, rather than understand the term as *the* “Sasana,” the Buddha’s “dispensation”

[^8]: *uppādāgamane*, lit., “coming on of omens (RD: *uppāda* 1, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss *utpāta*)” or “arrival of omens.” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> glosses *°āgamane* as *śāstrayehi*, “traditional learning” (about omens), apparently conflating the term with *āgama*, which can mean the scriptures of manuals of particular religious groups, or more generally “meaning, understanding,” likewise a meaning of the root *ā* + *gam*. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> explains this *utpātaśāstra* as “declaring \[omens\] good or bad (*śubhāśubha*) having looked at/with an eye toward unnatural changes connected with ghosts (*bhūtayan piḷibanda asvābhāvika venasvīm balā*)

[^9]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss takes this *lakṣaṇaśāstra* as involving the signs on the body/science of interpreting bodily marks.

[^10]: *vināyako*

[^11]: *tīṇisantharakaŋ katvā*

[^12]: *madhuvasso* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *madhuvassaṃ*) *pavassittha*

I follow <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss in translating this <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reading.

[^15]: lit., “I am a receiver of”

[^16]: lit., “I attained the destruction of the outflows” (*āsavakkhayaŋ*). This has to be read as a reference to the much later (present) life, for if he had become an arahant in the time of Sikhi Buddha he would not have been reborn during the time of the present (Gotama) Buddha.

[^20]: reading *mūlake* with <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> (and <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> alt.) as preferable to BTJTS *mūle*, which would make this line (only) an eleven-syllable foot.

[^21]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> treats this as two four-footed verses with six- (rather than eight-) syllable feet; <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> treats it as a singe verse with twelve-syllable feet. Except the divergences indicated, the Pāli is the same in both.

[^22]: reading *majjhe mahante hīne* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *majjhe mayhaŋ bhāvā*, “my existences in the middle.”

[^23]: here too <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> agree in presenting the variant reading
