*\[391. {394.}*[^1] *Madhudāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
I had a well-made hermitage,  
on the banks of River Indus.  
There[^3] I am instructing students  
in history and \[reading\] signs. (1) \[3706\]  
They lived on the Indus’ slopes,  
desiring teachings,[^4] learned folks,[^5]  
masters in Vedic sciences,[^6]  
wanting to hear good instruction.[^7] (2) \[3707\]  
They were skilled in interpreting[^8]  
omens as well as \[reading\] signs.[^9]  
Searching for ultimate meaning,  
they then dwelt within the forest. (3) \[3708\]  
The Sambuddha named Sumedha  
arose in the world at that time.  
Being \[filled\] with pity for us,  
the \[Buddha, the\] Guide,[^10] approached \[us\]. (4) \[3709\]  
Fashioning a mat out of grass[^11]  
for Sumedha, the World’s Leader,  
the Great Hero who had approached,  
I gave \[it\] to the World’s Best One. (5) \[3710\]  
Taking honey from the forest,  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha.  
The Sambuddha, having consumed  
\[it\], spoke these words \[to us back then\]: (6) \[3711\]  
“He who gave this honey to me,  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[his\] own hands,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (7) \[3712\]  
Because of this honey-giving,  
and because of the mat of grass,  
for thirty thousand aeons he  
will delight in the world of gods. (8) \[3713\]  
\[After\] thirty thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (9) \[3714\]  
Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (10) \[3715\]  
Coming here from the world of gods,  
\[when I\] approached \[my\] mother’s womb,  
there then rained a rain of honey;[^12]  
the earth was covered with honey.[^13] (11) \[3716\]  
When I was coming out from the  
womb, as though very unhappily,[^14]  
there again a rain of honey  
is raining for me constantly. (12) \[3717\]  
Having departed from the house,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
I am receiving[^15] food \[and\] drink:  
that’s the fruit of giving honey. (13) \[3718\]  
\[Whether\] born human \[or\] divine,  
I succeed in all \[my\] wishes.  
Just because of that honey-gift,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.[^16] (14) \[3719\]  
When the god is raining, I am always living  
undefiled \[and\] happy, on grass four fingers \[high\],  
or[^17] covered[^18] by a tree \[bursting forth\] in full bloom,[^19]  
in an empty house, a pavilion, \[or\] tree root.[^20] (15-16)
\[3720\][^21]  
I’ve overcome all existence,  
great \[or\] small \[or\] in the middle.[^22]  
Today I’m free of defilements;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (17) \[3721\]  
In the thirty thousand aeons  
since I gave that gift at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving honey. (18) \[3722\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
All defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (19) \[3723\]  
My being in Buddha’s presence[^23]  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (20) \[3724\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (21) \[3725\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Madhudāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Madhudāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Honey Donor”  
[^3]: reading *tattha* with BJTS for PTS *tassa,* “his”  
[^4]: *dhammakāmā.* BJTS gloss just gives *dharmakāmī*. I do not
    capitalize “teachings” because I assume the term is used more
    generically to mean doctrines, rather than *the* Dhamma.  
[^5]: *vinītā*  
[^6]: *chalaṅge,* lit., “six branches” of Vedic science. RD, S.V.: “the
    set of six Vedāngas, disciplines of Vedic science, viz. 1. kappa, 2.
    vyākaraṇā, 3. nirutti, 4. sikkhā, 5. chando (viciti), 6. joti-sattha
    (thus enumd at VvA 265; at PvA 97 in sequence 4, 1, 3, 2, 6, 5): D
    iii.269; Vv 6316; Pv ii.613; Miln 178, 236.”  
[^7]: reading *susāsanaṃ sotukāmā* with BJTS for PTS *sotukāmā pi
    sāsanaŋ,* “also wanting to hear instructions.” BJTS gloss gives
    *anuśāsanaya asanu kämättā,* “desiring to listen to instructions,”
    and I follow suit in the generic translation here, rather than
    understand the term as *the* “Sasana,” the Buddha’s “dispensation”  
[^8]: *uppādāgamane,* lit., “coming on of omens (RD: *uppāda* 1, BJTS
    gloss *utpāta*)” or “arrival of omens.” BJTS glosses *ºāgamane* as
    *śāstrayehi*, “traditional learning” (about omens), apparently
    conflating the term with *āgama*, which can mean the scriptures of
    manuals of particular religious groups, or more generally “meaning,
    understanding,” likewise a meaning of the root *ā+gam.* BJTS
    explains this *utpātaśāstra* as “declaring \[omens\] good or bad
    (*śubhāśubha*) having looked at/with an eye toward unnatural changes
    connected with ghosts (*bhūtayan piḷibanda asvābhāvika venasvīm
    balā*)  
[^9]: BJTS gloss takes this *lakṣaṇaśāstra* as involving the signs on
    the body/science of interpreting bodily marks.  
[^10]: *vināyako*  
[^11]: *tīṇisantharakaŋ katvā*  
[^12]: *madhuvasso* (BJTS reads *madhuvassaṃ*) *pavassittha*  
[^13]: *chādayaŋ madhunā mahiŋ*  
[^14]: reading *kucchiyā va suduttaraṃ* (lit., “as though very hard to
    cross over from the womb”) with BJTS for PTS *kumbiyā vasuduttaraŋ*
    (“from a pot over the earth” ?). I follow BJTS gloss in translating
    this BJTS reading.  
[^15]: lit., “I am a receiver of”  
[^16]: lit., “I attained the destruction of the outflows”
    (*āsavakkhayaŋ*). This has to be read as a reference to the much
    later (present) life, for if he had become an arahant in the time of
    Sikhi Buddha he would not have been reborn during the time of the
    present (Gotama) Buddha.  
[^17]: lit., “and,” *ca*  
[^18]: reading *sañchanne* with BJTS for PTS *ca chappade* (“and with
    six feet”?)  
[^19]: reading *sampupphite* with BJTS for PTS *samphīte*  
[^20]: reading *mūlake* with PTS (and BJTS alt.) as preferable to BTJTS
    *mūle,* which would make this line (only) an eleven-syllable foot.  
[^21]: PTS treats this as two four-footed verses with six- (rather than
    eight-) syllable feet; BJTS treats it as a singe verse with
    twelve-syllable feet. Except the divergences indicated, the Pāli is
    the same in both.  
[^22]: reading *majjhe mahante hīne* with BJTS for PTS *majjhe mayhaŋ
    bhāvā,* “my existences in the middle.”  
[^23]: here too BJTS and PTS agree in presenting the variant reading
