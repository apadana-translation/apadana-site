### \[254. Ti<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampakapupphiya[^1]\]

In the Himalayan region  
there’s a mountain named Vikaṭa.[^2]  
In its midst was[^3] dwelling \[back then\]  
a monk with senses \[well-\]controlled. (1) \[2511\]

After seeing that \[monk’s\] calmness,  
with \[my own\] mind very lucid,  
gathering three champak flowers  
I strew those \[blossoms\] about \[there\]. (2) \[2512\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2513\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2514\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ti<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampakapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ti<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampakapupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Three-*<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>ampaka*-Flower-er”. The *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampaka* (Sinh. *sapu*) tree is *Magnolia champaca*, formerly classified as *michelia champaca*. English names for the tree include Champak, Joy Perfume Tree, Yellow Jade Orchid Tree and Fragrant Himalayan Champaca. It was the Bodhi tree of the seventeenth Buddha of the *Buddhavaṃsa*, Atthadassi. It has highly fragrant cream to yellowish-colored blossoms.

[^2]: this is the only reference to the mountain recorded in DPPN. The term means “disgusting” “foul” “filthy” “degraded” as in *vikaṭabhojana*, spoiled or rotten food.

[^3]: lit., “is”
