*\[254. Ticampakapupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
In the Himalayan region  
there’s a mountain named Vikaṭa.[^2]  
In its midst was[^3] dwelling \[back then\]  
a monk with senses \[well-\]controlled. (1) \[2511\]

After seeing that \[monk’s\] calmness,  
with \[my own\] mind very lucid,  
gathering three champak flowers  
I strew those \[blossoms\] about \[there\]. (2) \[2512\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2513\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2514\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ticampakapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ticampakapupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Three-*Campaka*-Flower-er”. The *campaka* (Sinh. *sapu*) tree is
    *Magnolia champaca,* formerly classified as *michelia champaca*.
    English names for the tree include Champak, Joy Perfume Tree, Yellow
    Jade Orchid Tree and Fragrant Himalayan Champaca. It was the Bodhi
    tree of the seventeenth Buddha of the *Buddhavaṃsa*, Atthadassi. It
    has highly fragrant cream to yellowish-colored blossoms.

[^2]: this is the only reference to the mountain recorded in DPPN. The
    term means “disgusting” “foul” “filthy” “degraded” as in
    *vikaṭabhojana,* spoiled or rotten food.

[^3]: lit., “is”
