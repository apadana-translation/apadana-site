### \[266. Ma<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chadāyaka[^1]\]

On <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andabhāgā River’s bank  
I was an osprey[^2] at that time.  
I brought[^3] a big fish and gave it  
to the Buddha \[named\] Siddhattha. (1) \[2562\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I donated that fish back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of fish donations. (2) \[2563\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2564\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ma<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ma<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chadāyaka Thera is finished.
