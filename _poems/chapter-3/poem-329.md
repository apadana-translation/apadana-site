*\[329. Pupphacchattiya*[^1]*\]*

Bringing water-born lotuses,[^2]

hundred-leafed, delighting the mind,

and making \[it\], I offered a

floral umbrella to Buddha,

the Blessed One, Siddhattha,

the World’s Best One, the Neutral One,

when he was declaring the truth,

giving living beings succor. (1-2) \[2898-2899\]

And Siddhattha, World-Knower,

Sacrificial Recipient,

standing in the monks’ Assembly,[^3]

the Teacher spoke this verse \[for me\]: (3) \[2900\]

“\[This one\] who pleased \[his\] heart in me

\[and\] made a floral umbrella,

due to that mental pleasure he

will not go to a bad rebirth.” (4) \[2901\]

Having said this, the Sambuddha,

Siddhattha, Leader of the World,

taking leave of his retinue

rose up into the sky, the sky![^4] (5) \[2902\]

When the Man-God[^5] had risen up

the white umbrella also rose.

That unexcelled umbrella \[then\]

went in front of the Best Buddha. (6) \[2903\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I offered \[him\] that umbrella,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

fruit of a floral umbrella. (7) \[2904\]

In the seventy-fourth aeon

there were eight \[named\] Jalasikha,[^6]

wheel-turning monarchs with great power,

possessors of the seven gems. (8) \[2905\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[2906\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pupphacchattiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pupphacchattiya Thera is finished.

[^2]: here as in so many places, the singular is used in what is almost
    certainly a plural sense, and I translate accordingly. xxx to the
