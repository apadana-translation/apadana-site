*\[78. Pāṭalipupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
Back then I was a rich man’s son,  
delicate, living in comfort.  
Putting a trumpet flower[^2] in  
my lap I \[then\] took it to him,  
the Gold-Colored One, Sambuddha,  
traveling through the market-place,  
bearing the marks of a Great Man,[^3]  
like a festoon work made of gold. (1-2) \[1458-1459\]  
Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
with the flower I performed *pūjā*  
to Tissa, the World-Knower, Lord,  
having worshipped the God of Men. (3) \[1460\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of flower-*pūjā.* (4) \[1461\]

Sixty-three aeons ago the  
\[king\] known as Abhisammata  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[1462\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1463\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pāṭalipupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pāṭalipupphiya Thera is finished.
