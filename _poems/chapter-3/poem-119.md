*\[119. Paccupaṭṭhānasaññaka*[^1]*\]*  
Right when Well-Gone Atthadassi  
had achieved final nirvana,  
I was born in a spirit’s[^2] womb;  
I possessed \[great\] glory back then. (1) \[1748\]

“It’s a bad attainment for me,  
a bad dawn, a bad arising,  
that I should find such opulence  
when the Eyeful One’s passed away.”[^3] (2) \[1749\]

Discerning what I was thinking,  
the follower named Sāgara[^4]  
with a wish for my upliftment,  
\[then\] came into my presence \[there\]: (3) \[1750\]

“Why are you grieving? Do not fear!  
o \[you\] knower of the Teaching,  
by the Buddha have been given  
the seeds of everyone’s success. (4) \[1751\]

He who’d worship the Sambuddha,  
Siddhattha, Leader of the World,  
should worship even one small[^5] bone[^6]  
after the final nirvana. (5) \[1752\]

When the heart’s pleasure is the same  
there is the same priceless merit.  
Therefore having built a stupa,  
worship the Victor’s relics \[there\].” (6) \[1753\]

After hearing Sāgara’s words,  
I \[then\] built a Buddha-stupa.  
For five years I attended to  
that Sage’s ultimate stupa. (7) \[1754\]

Due to that deed for the Biped-Lord,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
having enjoyed \[great\] happiness,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (8) \[1755\]

In the seventh aeon ago  
there were four \[named\] Bhūripañña,[^7]  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (9) \[1756\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[1757\]

Thus indeed Venerable Paccupaṭṭhānasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Paccupaṭṭhānasaññaka Thera is finished.
