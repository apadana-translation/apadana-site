### \[410. {413.}[^1] Tiṇasūlakachādaniya[^2]\]

At that time I contemplated  
birth and decrepitude \[and\] death.  
Going out \[from the home\] alone,[^3]  
I went forth into homelessness. (1) \[4346\]

In the course of wandering, I  
came to[^4] the banks of a river.[^5]  
There on the riverbank I saw  
\[a piece of\] earth in all fullness.[^6] (2) \[4347\]

Fashioning a hermitage there,  
I’m living in the hermitage.  
My walkway is well-constructed,  
housing[^7] flocks[^8] of various birds.[^9] (3) \[4348\]

Trustingly they come up to me,  
and sing[^10] \[their\] lovely \[songs to me\].  
Delighting[^11] \[there\] along with them,  
I’m living in the hermitage. (4) \[4349\]

Near that hermitage of mine were  
wild beasts of four \[different\] kinds,  
who came out of their[^12] \[forest\] haunts  
and roared \[for me\] like the thunder. (5) \[4350\]

When those wild beasts were making sounds,  
\[great\] mirth was \[then\] produced in me.  
\[While\] searching for \[those\] animals,[^13]  
I saw the Leader of the World. (6) \[4351\]

\[Then\] having seen the God of Gods,  
Tissa, Chief Leader of the World,  
happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I offered[^14] ironwood pollen.[^15] (7) \[4352\]

I praised the Leader of the World,  
like the sun \[when it\] is rising,  
like a regal *sal* tree in bloom,  
shining forth like the morning star:[^16] (8) \[4353\]

“Omniscient One, with your knowledge,  
you light up this \[world\] with \[its\] gods.  
After having made you happy,  
they’re liberated from rebirth. (9) \[4354\]

Omniscient One, through not seeing  
the[^17] Buddhas who see everything,  
those obstructed by lust \[and\] hate  
descend[^18] into *avīci* hell.[^19] (10) \[4355\]

Coming to take a look at you,  
Omniscient One, O World-Leader,  
they are freed from all existence,  
\[and\] realize[^20] the deathless state. (11) \[4356\]

When the Buddhas, the Eyeful Ones,  
the Light-Bringers are arising,  
they display the light \[of the truth\],  
burning up \[all the\] defilements.” (12) \[4357\]

After praising the Sambuddha,  
Tissa, Chief Leader of the World,  
happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I offered[^21] Arab jasmine[^22] blooms. (13) \[4358\]

Discerning what I was thinking,  
Tissa, Chief Leader of the World,  
sitting down \[there\] on \[his\] own seat,  
spoke these verses \[about me then\]: (14) \[4359\]

“He who covered me with flowers,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by his own hands,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (15) \[4360\]

Twenty-five times he’s going to  
exercise rule over the gods,  
and seventy-five times he’ll be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (16) \[4361\]

\[And there will be\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting,  
as a result of his karma  
of doing *pūjā* with[^23] flowers. (17) \[4362\]

When this person has bathed his head,  
if[^24] he wishes for a flower,  
\[then\] bound up with his good[^25] karma,  
\[it\] will appear in front of \[him\]. (18) \[4363\]

Whatever’s wished for through desires,  
that all is going to appear.  
Having fulfilled \[his\] intentions,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled. (19) \[4364\]

The eighteenth recitation portion  
Having burnt up the defilements,  
attentive and intelligent,  
sitting down on a single seat,  
he will attain arahantship.” (20) \[4365\]

Walking back and forth, lying down,  
sitting down or else standing up,  
remembering the Best Buddha,  
I am living all of the time.[^26] (21) \[4366\]

There’s no deficiency for me  
in robes and food that I beg for,  
in requisites \[and\] bed-and-seat:[^27]  
that’s the fruit of Buddha*-pūjā*. (22) \[4367\]

Now deathlessness has been attained,  
the unsurpassed \[great\] state of peace.  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
I am living without constraint.[^28] (23) \[4368\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did *pūjā* to the Buddha,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha*-pūjā*. (24) \[4369\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (25) \[4370\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (26) \[4371\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (27) \[4372\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tiṇasūlakachādaniya[^29] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tiṇasūlakachādaniya[^30] Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Arabian-Jasmine-Flower-Coverer,“ BJTS reads *Tiṇasūlakachadaniya*, with the same meaning. DPPN I:1008 leaves *Tiṇasūla* untranslated; BJTS Sinhala gloss is *bōlidda*, Arabian Jasmine, a fragrant small white flower (*ºidda*) which flowers in ball-like (*bōlº*) clusters.

[^3]: *ekato* is the ablative form of *eka*, the number “one” which also functions as an indefinite article. I am reading it here as though it were *ekatta* (“alone”) following the BJTS Sinh. gloss (*ekalāva* = alone, singly) rather than, as is the more common Pāli usage, “together”.

[^4]: *upāgamin*, “went up to” “approached”

[^5]: or “the banks of the Ganges,” *gaṅgātīram*

[^6]: *paṭhaviŋ…supaṇṇataŋ*, I suppose “fullness of flora and fauna,” given the subsequent verses.

[^7]: *ºāyuto*, lit., “connected with” “furnished with” “endowed with” “possessing”

[^8]: *ºgaṇaº*, “groups”.

[^9]: *nānādijaº*

[^10]: *kūjanti*

[^11]: reading *ramamāno* with BJTS for PTS *ramamāṇo*

[^12]: I take the 3rd sing. *so* (and the declension of the verb, *gajji*, “it roared”) apposite “four kinds” (*catukamo*), so translate in the plural even though the pronoun and verb are singular.

[^13]: lit., “for those wild beasts”

[^14]: lit., “did *pūjā*”

[^15]: *nāgakesaraŋ*, BJTS gloss specifies that the meaning is “pollen of ironwood (*nā, nāga*) flowers.”

[^16]: *osadhī*. RD (s.v.) points out that all we really know about this star is that it was particularly bright, leading Childers to translate it as “Venus” and others as the morning star.

[^17]: lit., “of,” gen. case, “not-seeing of Buddhas”

[^18]: *patantya&lt;patanti*, note the Sanskritic *sandhi* here

[^19]: *avīcinirayaŋ*, a particularly oppressive hell-state

[^20]: *phusanti*

[^21]: lit., “did *pūjā*”

[^22]: *tiṇasūlaŋ*, Sinh. *bōlidda*

[^23]: lit., “of”

[^24]: reading *yadi* with BJTS for the second *ayaŋ* in PTS

[^25]: lit., “meritorious”

[^26]: reading *sadā* (“always” “all the time”) with BJTS for PTS *tadā* (“then”)

[^27]: or “residence”

[^28]: or “free of the outflows,” “undefiled,” *anāsavo*

[^29]: BJTS reads *Tiṇasūlakachadaniya*

[^30]: BJTS reads *Tiṇasūlakachadaniya*
