*\[192. Tiṇasantharadāyaka*[^1]*\]*

What grass a forest-dwelling sage

is reaping for the \[Great\] Teacher,

all those \[blades\] turning to the right[^2]

fell down upon the earth \[back then\]. (1) \[2219\]

That I, taking \[a load of\] grass

and bringing \[blades of\] grass and leaves

of palmyra[^3] \[did make\] a mat,

\[spread out\] on the excellent ground. (2) \[2220\]

Fashioning that grass \[and those\] leaves,

I gave \[that mat\] to Siddhattha;

for seven days I bore it there

for the Teacher of Gods and Men. (3) \[2221\]

In the ninety-four aeons since

I gave \[the Buddha\] grass back then

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of a gift of grass. (4) \[2222\]

In the sixty-fifth aeon hence

there were four \[named\] Mahādhana,[^4]

wheel-turning monarchs with great strength,

possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[2223\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2224\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tiṇasantharadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tiṇasantharadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Grass Mat Donor”

[^2]: *padakkhiṇāvattā* (BJTS Sinhala gloss *dakṣiṇāvarta vä*) contains
    a *double entendre* in Pāli (and Sinhala) which I have tried to
    preserve in English: the (physical) turning to the right of the
    leaves (itself auspicious, in the proper “circumambulation” to show
    respect, “keeping the right” to the object of veneration) is
    simultaneously a (metaphorical) turning toward what is right, good,
    skillful (or even, “turning into religious gifts,” *dakkhiṇā*)

[^3]: the palmyra (*tāla,* Sinh. *tal*) tree or fan palm is Borassus
    flabelliformis

[^4]: “Great Wealth”
