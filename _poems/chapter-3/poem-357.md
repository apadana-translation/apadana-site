*\[354. {357.}*[^1] *Supuṭakapūjaka*[^2]*\]*

Going out \[after\] his siesta,

Vipassi \[Buddha\], World-Leader,

wandering about for alms food,

came into my presence \[back then\]. (1) \[3165\]

After that, happy, exulted,

giving a good bag \[full\] of salt

to the World’s Best, the Neutral One,

I joyed an aeon in heaven. (2) \[3166\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I gave \[the Buddha\] that good bag,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of a good bag-gift. (3) \[3167\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3168\]

Thus indeed Venerable Supuṭakapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Supuṭakapūjaka Thera is finished.
