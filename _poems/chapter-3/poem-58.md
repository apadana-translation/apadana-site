### \[58. Dhajadāyaka[^1]\]

Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart  
I hoisted up a flag \[back then\]  
at the stupendous Bodhi Tree[^2]  
of Padumuttara Buddha. (1) \[1314\]

Having picked up the fallen leaves  
I threw \[them all\] away outside.  
As though facing the Sambuddha,  
the Fully Free One, Undefiled,  
I worshipped the superb Bodhi,  
clean inside \[and\] clean outside \[too\]. (2) \[1315\][^3]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
standing in the monks’ Assembly  
the Teacher spoke these verses \[then\]: (3) \[1316\]

“Because of both this service and  
this donation of a flag \[here,\]  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
he will go to no bad rebirth.  
Among the gods he will enjoy  
abundant divine happiness. (4) \[1317-1318a-b\][^4]

And various hundreds of times,  
he’ll be king of a country.  
He will be a wheel-turning king;  
his name will \[then\] be Uggata.[^5] (5) \[1318c-f\]

Having enjoyed \[this\] happiness,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
he will delight in the Teaching  
of Gotama the Blessed One.” (6) \[1319\]

I am one bent on exertion,  
calmed,[^6] devoid of grounds for rebirth;[^7]  
I am bearing my last body  
in the Supreme Buddha’s teaching. (7) \[1320\]

Fifty-one thousand aeons \[hence\]  
\[I was\] known as \[King\] Uggata.  
Fifty thousand aeons \[ago\]  
\[I was\] the king[^8] known as Megha. (8) \[1321\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1322\]

Thus indeed Venerable Dhajadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Dhajadāyaka is finished.
