*\[60. Asanabodhiya*[^1]*\]*  
\[When\] I was \[but\] seven years old  
I saw the \[Buddha\], World-Chief.  
Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart  
I went up to the Best of Men. (1) \[1334\]  
Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I planted the best Bodhi tree  
for \[him\], Tissa, the Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One. (2) \[1335\]  
Foot-drinker growing in the earth,[^2]  
it was known as an “Asana”.  
For five years I tended that \[tree\],  
the superb Asana Bodhi. (3) \[1336\]  
Having seen that flowering tree,  
marvel making hair stand on end,  
relating my own karma \[then\]  
I went up to the Best Buddha. (4) \[1337\]  
Tissa, who was then Sambuddha,  
Self-Become One, the Top Person,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly  
spoke these verses \[about me then\]: (5) \[1338\]  
“I shall relate details of him  
who has planted this Bodhi \[Tree\]  
and honored \[me with\] Buddha-*pūjā*;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (6) \[1339\]  
For thirty aeons among gods  
he will exercise divine rule,  
and four and sixty times he’ll be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (7) \[1340\]  
Falling from Tusitā heaven,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
experiencing the two-fold bliss,  
he’ll delight in the human state. (8) \[1341\]  
Being one bent on exertion,  
calmed,[^3] devoid of grounds for rebirth,[^4]  
knowing well all the defilements  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (9) \[1342\]  
Binding \[myself\] to solitude,  
calm of mind, with desires blown out,  
like a tusker with broken chains,  
I’m living without defilements. (10) \[1343\]  
In the ninety-two aeons since  
I planted that Bodhi back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of planting Bodhis. (11) \[1344\]  
Seventy-four aeons ago  
I was a wheel-turning monarch.  
\[I was\] known as Daṇḍasena,[^5]  
possessor of the seven gems. (12) \[1345\]  
Seventy-three aeons ago  
there were[^6] seven lords on the earth.  
They were \[all\] wheel-turning monarchs  
who were named Samantanemi.[^7] (13) \[1346\]  
Five and twenty aeons ago  
the Kṣatriyan named Puṇṇaka  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (14) \[1347\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (15) \[1348\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Asanabodhiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Asanabodhiya Thera is finished.  
The Summary:  
Vījanī and Sataraŋsī  
Sayan, Odaki, Vāhiya,  
Parivāra and Padīpa,  
Dhaja, Paduma-Pūjaka  
and Bodhi’s said to be the tenth;  
thus two and ninety verses.  
The Vījanī Chapter, the Sixth.  
[^1]: “*Asana* Bodhi Tree-er.” *Asana* is Pentaptera tomentosa, = a.k.a.
    crocodile-bark tree, Indian laurel, silver grey wood, white chuglam.
    The Bodhi tree of Tissa Buddha. BJTS glosses as *piyā, bakmī;*
    Sarcocephalus cordatus *(Rubi.)*.  
[^2]: this compound consists of two different words for” tree”:
    *dharaṇī-rūha* (“growing in the earth”) and *pādapa* (“drinking from
    the feet \[or roots\]”). Though awkward in English, I translate
    literally here rather than give the non-descriptive “tree, which was
    a tree”.  
[^3]: *upasanto*  
[^4]: *nirūpadhi*  
[^5]: “Rod and Army”  
[^6]: i.e., “I was reborn as”  
[^7]: “Complete Circumference” “Rim on All Edges”
