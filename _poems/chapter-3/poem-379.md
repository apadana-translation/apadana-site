*\[376. {379.}*[^1] *Sumanadāmadāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
Having made a wreath of jasmine,  
I stood carrying it in front  
of Siddhattha, the Blessed One,  
the Well-Bathed One, the Ascetic.[^3](1) \[3267\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I carried that wreath \[of jasmine\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit in carrying jasmine. (2) \[3268\]

My being in Buddha’s presence[^4]  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[3269\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[3270\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[3271\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sumanadāmadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Sumanadāmadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^2]: “Jasmine Wreath (or Garland) Donor”

[^3]: the two epithets in this foot -- *nhātaka* (*nahātaka,* “one who has bathed”) and *tapassin* (“practicer of austerities”) -- are typically reserved for non-Buddhist adepts. The former refers to a brahmin who has received his ritual bath upon completion of his Vedic studies (though it is also used in a Buddhist sense, according to RD, at DhA iv.232, and in a more general sense of having “washed away all sins” at SN 521, 646). The latter refers to an ascetic who cultivates inner heat through the sorts of austere and self-mortifying practices renounced by the Bodhisattva prior to achieving Buddhahood (but according to RD is also used in a more general sense to refer to one who has achieved mastery over the senses, including Gotama Buddha, e.g., Vin i.234=A iv.184).

[^4]: BJTS read "Being in Best Buddha's presence”
