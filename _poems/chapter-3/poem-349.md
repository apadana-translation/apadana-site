### \[346. {349.}[^1] Tiṇḍukaphaladāyaka[^2]\]

I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
the Flood-Crosser, Undefiled One,[^3]  
sitting down on a mountainside,  
shining like a dinner-plate tree.[^4] (1) \[3132\]

Seeing wild mangosteen[^5] in bloom,  
I broke off sprigs[^6] with \[fruit on them\].  
Happy, \[my\] heart \[filled\] with pleasure,  
I gave them to \[him\], Vessabhu. (2) \[3133\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave that fruit \[to the Buddha\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[3134\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3135\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tiṇḍukaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tiṇḍukaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.
