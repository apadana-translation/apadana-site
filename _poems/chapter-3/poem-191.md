*Tamālapupphiya Chapter, the Twentieth*  
*\[191. Tamālapupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
My magically-made mansion,  
with eighty-four lakhs of pillars,  
was a \[lovely\] golden \[color\],  
the equal of a divine tree.[^2] (1) \[2214\]

Plucking a *tamāla* flower  
with a mind \[which was\] very clear,  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha  
Sikhi, the Kinsman of the World. (2) \[2215\]

in the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2216\]

In the twentieth aeon ago  
there was one \[named\] Candatitta,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2217\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2218\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tamālapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Tamālapupphiya Thera is finished.

    Xanthochymus (*Guttif.*); bears greenish-white flowers and a fruit
    used for jams and curries.
