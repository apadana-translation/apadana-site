*\[327. Nigguṇḍipupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
When according to \[his\] lifespan,  
a god falls from the world,[^2]  
three sayings[^3] get emitted \[then,\]  
\[in\] the rejoicing of the gods. (1) \[2863\][^4]  
“From here, sir,[^5] go to a good state,  
in the company of people.  
Becoming human do obtain  
great faith in the Excellent Truth.[^6] (2) \[2864\]

Having established that, your faith,  
in the well-known Excellent Truth,  
\[well-\]fixed, born of \[those happy\] roots,  
\[be\] steadfast as long as \[you\] live. (3) \[2865\]

Doing good deeds[^7] with \[your\] body,  
\[and doing\] much good with \[your\] speech;  
doing good with \[your\] mind \[as well,\]  
\[be\] free of hate and attachment.[^8] (4) \[2866\]

Thus exalting the life \[you live\],  
doing merit with much giving,  
make other men also enter  
the chaste life \[and\] Excellent Truth.” (5) \[2867\]

When gods know that a god’s falling,[^9]  
\[filled\] with this \[sort of\] compassion,  
they rejoice \[about his rebirth\]:  
“O god come \[back\] repeatedly.” (6) \[2868\]

I was moved when at that time the  
assembly of gods had gathered,  
“Well now then to what womb should I  
go when \[I have\] fallen from here?” (7) \[2869\]

Padumuttara’s follower,  
known by the name of Sumana,[^10]  
a monk with senses \[well-\]controlled,  
realizing that I was moved  
\[and\] desiring to lift me up,  
did come into my presence then  
\[and\] stirred me up instructing \[me\]  
in the meaning and the Teaching.[^11] (8-9) \[2870-2871\]  
The Twelfth Recitation Portion[^12]  
Having listened to his words I  
made \[my\] heart pleased in the Buddha.  
Having saluted that hero[^13]  
I \[then\] passed away on the spot. (10) \[2872\]

I was reborn right then and there,  
incited by \[those\] happy roots.  
Even dwelling in mother’s womb,  
I was my mother’s instructor.[^14] (11) \[2873\]

Having fallen from that body  
I was reborn in Thirty-Three.[^15]  
Within that \[heaven\], then, for me,  
mental disturbance was not seen. (12) \[2874\]

Fallen from Tāvatiŋsa \[too,\]  
I[^16] came in to a mother’s womb.  
Coming out from \[that\] womb I knew  
\[the diff’rence between\] black and white.[^17] (13) \[2875\]

Being \[only\] seven years old,  
I entered the park-hermitage[^18]  
of Gotama, the Blessed One,  
the Śākyan Son, the Neutral One. (14) \[2876\]

When the dispensation had spread  
\[and\] the Teaching[^19] was popular,[^20]  
I saw the Teacher’s \[own\] monks there,  
doers of his dispensation. (15) \[2877\]

The city there, named Śrāvasti  
had a king known as Kosala.  
By elephant-chariot he  
came to the supreme Bodhi \[tree\]. (16) \[2878\]

Having seen his elephant \[there\],  
recalling \[my own\] past karma,  
pressing both my hands together,  
I \[also\] went to the event.[^21] (17) \[2879\]

Being \[only\] seven years old,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
He who looked after the Buddha  
was the follower Ānanda,[^22]  
perfectly behaved, resolute,  
mindful and very learned too.  
He took charge of the Brilliant One,[^23]  
bringing pleasure to the king’s heart. (18-19) \[2880-2881\]  
After having heard his Teaching,  
I recalled \[my own\] past karma.  
Standing in that very \[spot\] I  
\[then\] attained \[my\] arahantship. (20) \[2882\]

Putting a robe on one shoulder.  
hands pressed together on \[my\] head,  
saluting \[him\], the Sambuddha,  
I uttered this speech \[then and there\]: (21) \[2883\]

“Gathering *nigguṇḍi*[^24] blossoms  
I placed them on the lion-throne  
of Padumuttara Buddha,  
the Lord of Bipeds, the Teacher. (22) \[2884\]

Through that deed, O Biped Lord,  
O World’s Best, O Bull among Men,  
I’ve achieved the un-shaking state  
without victory or defeat. (23) \[2285\]

In aeon twenty-five-thousand,[^25]  
royal[^26] lords of men numbered in  
crore-hundred-trillions and hundred-  
trillion-hundred-trillions, eight each.[^27] (24) \[2886\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (25) \[2887\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nigguṇḍipupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Nigguṇḍipupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “*Nigguṇḍi*-Flower-er.” Cf. \#205, above. Here PTS spells through
    nearly certain error *Nigguṇṭhiº.* I follow the BJTS reading here.
    *Nigguṇḍi* is a kind of tree, *Vitex negunda.* Sinh: *nika,* Engl.
    “chaste tree,” “Chinese chaste tree” “five-leafed chaste tree”
    “horseshoe vitex”.

[^2]: or body (*kāyā*); this reading follows BJTS

[^3]: lit., sounds, objects of hearing

[^4]: vv\. 1-10 plus the first two feet of v. 11 here precisely parallel the
    same verses of \#187, above.

[^5]: *bho,* BJTS glosses *pinvata* (“O meritorious one”)

[^6]: *saddhamme*

[^7]: *kusalaŋ*

[^8]: lit., “\[be a person\] who is not one with ill-will, \[one who
    is\] free of attachment.”

[^9]: reading *devā devaṃ yadā vidū cavantaṃ* with BJTS for PTS
    *devadevaŋ yadā viduŋ*

[^10]: “Cheerful” or “Good-Minded”

[^11]: *atthadhammānusāsitvā*

[^12]: only in BJTS.

[^13]: here is the primary divergence, itself quite small, from the
    parallel passage in \#187

[^14]: accepting the PTS reading *dhāretu* and taking it as the nom.
    sing. the verbal noun *dhāretar,* “bearer in mind, causer to
    remember, instructor, teacher” in the range supplied by RD*.*
    Alternate readings (there are many, the text has obviously puzzled
    editors) are variant derivatives of the same root, to bear
    (*dharati*), mostly in this causative sense *(dhāreti,* to carry,
    possess, put on, hold back, restrain, bear in mind, understand) with
    the same basic intent that “I was the support of my mother \[rather
    than the other way around\] even when I was in her womb.”

[^15]: Tidasa, the heaven of the (roughly) thirty gods, equivalent to
    Tāvatiŋsa

[^16]: reading *samokkamiṃ* with BJTS for PTS *samokkamaŋ,* which would
    be a more impersonal still “there was a coming into a mother’s womb”

[^17]: *kaṇha+sukka*; “dark and bright” “black and white,” (one of the
    colorless color-sensations); by extension merit or demerit, *puñña*
    or *pāpa.* “Black” and “White” carry similar connotations in
    English, so I have translated accordingly.

[^18]: *ārāma,* any of a number of places, so-designated, where the
    Buddha dwelt (and where many of the *sutta*s were preached). Given
    the reference to Sāvatthi in the present instance (v. 16) this would
    likely be the *ārāma* donated by Anāthapiṇḍika*,* in the Jetavāna.

[^19]: *pāvacana* = *dhamma*, the “Good Word”

[^20]: *bahujañña,* “of the populace,” “among the multitude”

[^21]: *samaya*. Alternately, “I \[too\] went to the festival,” (which
    may overdetermine it) or (following cty, p. 477) “the gathering”
    (*samūhaṃ*), “I went to the place of gathering” (*samāgamaṭṭhānaṃ
    ahaṃ agamāsin ti attho*).

[^22]: lit., “the follower named Ānanda,” He is \#10, above. His name
    means “Joy.” The two halves of the verse barely connect, which may
    indicate some hiatus or a missing two feet, such that these two feet
    would belong with the subsequent verse, which would work better for
    the flow of the Pāli.

[^23]: taking *mahājutiŋ* as a Buddha-epithet.

[^24]: PTS *nigguṇṭhi*

[^25]: lit., “in the twenty-five-thousandth of the aeons”

[^26]: lit., kṣatriyan

[^27]: the text is based on two large numbers, “*abbudas* and
    *nirabudda*s” of previous/subsequent lives as a kṣatriyan king,
    apparently within that single aeon (the 25,000th ago). Cty (p. 477)
    defines *abbuda* and *nirabbuda* based on the unit called *koṭi*
    (“crore” in Indian English = 100 lakhs \[100,000\] = ten million). A
    *koṭi* of *koṭi*s (ten million squared = one hundred trillion) is a
    *pakoṭi*. A *koṭi* of *pakoṭi*s is an *abbuda* (10,000,000 cubed =
    ten-million-hundred-trillions); a *koṭi* of *abbuda*s is a
    *nirabudda* (ten million to the fourth power =
    hundred-trillion-hundred trillions). The text enumerates the
    previous-life kings in *abbuda*s and *nirabudda*s and is read by cty
    and BJTS to mean that there were eight of each sort, i.e., eight
    *abbuda*s and eight *nirabuddas*, = 8 x 10,000,000 cubed plus 8 x
    10,000,000 to the fourth
