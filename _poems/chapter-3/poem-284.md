*\[284. Ekapupphiya*[^1]*\]*

At that time I was a goblin,[^2]

\[residing\] at the southern gate.

I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,

\[bright but cool\] like a rayless sun.[^3] (1) \[2638\]

One flower was given by me

to Vipassi, the Chief of Men,

the Well-Wisher of Every World,[^4]

the Best Biped, the Neutral One. (2) \[2639\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I gave that flower \[to him\] back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2640\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2641\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekapupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “One Flower-er”

[^2]: *pisāco*

[^3]: *vītaraṃsa*; see above, note to \#215, v. 1 \[2339\]. xxx should
    this, and the two sun metaphors in \#215, and again in \#305, be
    treated as epithets? The distinction is taken to be the presence (or
    not, in the case of epithets) of comparative enclitics like *va,
    iva*

[^4]: *sabbalokahitesino*
