### \[162. Kaṇaverapupphiya[^1]\]

The Blessed One named Siddhattha,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
Honored by the monks’ Assembly,[^2]  
entered into the city \[then\]. (1) \[2056\]

In the king’s inner-chambers[^3] \[there\]  
I lived as the trusted[^4] watchman.  
When I was inside the palace,  
I saw the \[Buddha\], World-Leader. (2) \[2057\]

Taking a *kaṇavera* flower,  
I scattered \[it\] among the monks.[^5]  
Then I scattered \[some\] more of them  
for \[him\], the Buddha, separately. (3) \[2058\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did that flower-offering,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of flower-offering*.* (4) \[2059\]

In the eighty-seventh aeon  
there were four \[named\] Mahiddhika,[^6]  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[2060\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2061\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kaṇaverapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kaṇaverapupphiya Thera is finished.
