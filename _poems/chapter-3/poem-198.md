*\[198. Muṭṭhipūjaka*[^1]*\]*  
The Blessed One named Sumedha,  
the World’s Best, the Bull of Men,  
the Victor exerted \[himself,\][^2]  
with compassion for the lowly. (1) \[2255\]

I presented to the Buddha,  
Lord of Bipeds, the Neutral One,  
doing walking meditation,[^3]  
a handful of *girinil*[^4] blooms. (2) \[2256\]

Because of that mental pleasure,  
incited by those happy roots,  
during thirty thousand aeons  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth. (3) \[2257\]

In the twenty-three hundredth aeon  
there was one \[man\] who had great strength,  
a king[^5] whose name was Sunela,[^6]  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2258\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2259\]

Thus indeed Venerable Muṭṭhipūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Muṭṭhipūjaka Thera is finished.
