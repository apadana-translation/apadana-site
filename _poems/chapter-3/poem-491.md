*Kiṅkhanipupphiya*[^1] *Chapter, the Fiftieth*  
*\[488. {491.}*[^2] *Tīṇikiṅkhanipupphiya*[^3]*\]*  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
Vipassi, Leader of the World,  
shining like a dinner-plate tree,  
sitting on a mountainside. (1) \[5249\]

Taking three *kiṅkhani*[^4] flowers,  
I offered \[them to the Buddha\].  
Having worshipped[^5] the Sambuddha,  
I went off, my face to the south. (2) \[5250\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (3) \[5251\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* to \[that\] Buddha,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[5252\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[5253\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5254\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[5255\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tīṇikiṅkhanipupphiya[^6] Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Tīṇikiṅkhanipupphiya[^7] Thera is finished.
