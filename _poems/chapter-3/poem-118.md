*\[118. Maggasaññaka*[^1]*\]*  
Padumuttara Buddha’s \[own\]  
followers, who were forest-monks,  
were lost in a giant forest,  
wandering \[there\] like they were blind. (1) \[1742\]  
Calling to mind the Sambuddha,  
Padumuttara, the Leader,  
\[and\] they who were that Sage’s sons,  
lost in the great forest \[by then\], (2) \[1743\]  
descending[^2] from \[my\] residence  
I went to where the monks were \[then\]  
and having shown the road to them  
I \[also\] gave them food \[to eat\]. (3) \[1744\]  
Due to that deed for the Biped-Lord,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
being \[only\] seven years old,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (4) \[1745\]  
In the five hundredth aeon hence,  
there were twelve wheel-turning monarchs  
known by the name of Sacakkhu[^3]  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[1746\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1747\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Maggasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Maggasaññaka Thera is finished.
