*\[106. Udakapūjaka*[^1]*\]*  
\[I saw\] the golden Sambuddha  
going in the path of the wind,  
glistening like an oil-altar,[^2]  
blazing up like a fire-altar.[^3] (1) \[1639\]

Taking \[some\] water with my hand,  
I tossed it up into the sky.  
The Buddha, Compassionate, Sage,  
Great Hero, \[then\] accepted it. (2) \[1640\]

Standing in the sky, the Teacher,  
whose name was Padumuttara,  
discerning what I was thinking,  
spoke this verse \[about me just then\]: (3) \[1641\]

“Because of this gift of water  
and the joy that \[he\] produced \[then\],  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
he’ll come to know no bad rebirth.” (4) \[1642\]

Due to that deed for Buddha,[^4]  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state  
beyond \[all\] conquest and defeat. (5) \[1643\]

In the sixty-five hundredth aeon,  
there were three wheel-turning monarchs;  
\[all were\] named Sahassarāja[^5]  
lords over people on four sides. (6) \[1644\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1645\]

Thus indeed Venerable Udakapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Udakapūjaka Thera is finished.
