### \[173. Rattipupphiya[^1]\]

I was a deer-hunter back then,  
within a grove in the forest.  
I saw Vipassi Buddha \[then\],  
the God of Gods, the Bull of Men. (1) \[2116\]

Having seen red \[flowers\] blooming  
on a winter cherry[^2] tree \[then\],  
having taken \[them\] with \[their\] stems,  
I offered \[them\] to the Great Sage. (2) \[2117\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I offered \[those\] flower\[s\] \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving flowers. (3) \[2118\]

And in the eighth aeon ago,  
I was a monarch with great strength,  
with the name of Suppasanna,[^3]  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2119\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2120\]

Thus indeed Venerable Rattipupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Rattipupphiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Red Flower \[Donor\]”

[^2]: *kuṭaja*, Wrightia zeylanica, Sinhala *keḷinda*. Bot. dict.: “a tree bearing a medicinal nut or seed used as a remedy for diarrhoea;” other names include Conessi bark, Tellicherri bark, for the astringent bark which is also used toward this medicinal end; arctic snow. However, as its name implies, it bears small white flowers, making rather miraculous the appearance of red flowers blooming on it.

[^3]: “Very Pleased”
