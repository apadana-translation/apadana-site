*\[256. ‘Pāhanadāyaka*[^1]*\]*

Back then I was the Buddha’s son,

\[a boy whose\] name was Candana.[^2]

I donated one of my shoes

when your Awakening occurred. (1) \[2518\]

In the ninety-one aeons since

I donated that shoe back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of a gifted shoe. (2) \[2519\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances;

six special knowledges mastered:

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2520\]

Thus indeed Venerable ‘Pāhanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of ‘Pāhanadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: that is, Upāhana-dāyaka, supplying (as do some manuscripts) the
    elided “u”. “Shoe-donor”

[^2]: “Sandalwood”
