### \[52. Sataraŋsika[^1]\]

Ascending a rock outcropping,  
the Ultimate Man sat down \[there\].  
\[I\], a brahmin mantra-master  
in the region of that mountain, (1) \[1265\]

having pressed my hands together  
kindly praised \[him\], the World-Leader,  
the God of Gods, the Bull of Men,  
the Great Hero who had arrived: (2) \[1266\]

“This is the Buddha, Great Hero,  
the Preacher of the Best Teaching,  
like a blazing column of fire,  
Honored by the monks’ Assembly. (3) \[1267\]

Imperturbable as the sea,  
hard to cross as is the ocean,  
fearless as the king of the beasts,  
the Eyeful One preaches *Dhamma*.” (4) \[1268\]

Discerning what I was thinking,  
the \[Buddha\] named for the lotus,  
standing in the monks’ Assembly,  
the Teacher spoke these verses \[then\]: (5) \[1269\]

“This one who’s pressed hands together[^2]  
and has praised \[me\], the Best Buddha,  
for thirty thousand aeons \[hence\]  
he will exercise divine rule. (6) \[1270\]

In one hundred thousand aeons  
the one named for Angirasa,  
the Sambuddha, with Blinders Off,[^3]  
will come into existence then. (7) \[1271\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
the one known as Sataraŋsi  
will become an arahant \[then\].” (8) \[1272\]

Being \[only\] seven years old,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
I am known as Sataraŋsi;  
my light purifies \[the whole world\].[^4] (9) \[1273\]

On a stage or beneath a tree  
meditator, trance-lover,  
I am bearing my last body  
in the Supreme Buddha’s teaching. (10) \[1274\]

Sixty thousand aeons ago  
there were four men known as Roma.  
They were wheel-turners with great strength  
possessors of the seven gems. (11) \[1275\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[1276\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sataraŋsiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sataraŋsika[^5] Thera is finished.
