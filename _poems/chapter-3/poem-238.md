*\[238. Ambayāgadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
An expert[^2] in my field back then,  
I went into a forest grove,  
and seeing Buddha, the Calm One,  
I gave \[him\] a gift[^3] of mangoes. (1) \[2453\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that donation back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a mango-gift. (2) \[2454\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2455\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ambayāgadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ambayāgadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Mango-Sacrifice Donor”

[^2]: here following the cty, “well established in my own craft” “clever in my own art”

[^3]: *yāga* = sacrifice, *mahadāna* or “great gift;” more than just a handful, presumably.
