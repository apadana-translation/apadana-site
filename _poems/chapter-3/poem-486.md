### \[483. {486.}[^1] Dhātupūjaka[^2]\]

When the World’s Lord reached nirvana,  
Siddhattha, Leader of the World,  
having summoned my relatives,  
I worshipped[^3] \[that Buddha’s\] relics. (1) \[5135\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I worshipped[^4] \[those\] relics \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of relic-worship. (2) \[5136\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (3) \[5137\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[5138\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5139\]

Thus indeed Venerable Dhātupūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Dhātupūjaka Thera is finished.
