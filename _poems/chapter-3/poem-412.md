*\[409. {412.}*[^1] *Ekachattiya*[^2]*\]*  
On Candabhāgā River’s bank,  
I had a well-made hermitage.  
It was strewn with very white sand,  
\[and\] furnished with halls made of leaves. (1) \[4299\]

The river \[there\] was beautiful,  
with flat banks \[and\] good bathing-fords.  
It was full of fish and turtles;  
crocodiles resorted \[to it\]. (2) \[4300\]

\[There were\] bears, peacocks and leopards,  
Indian[^3] cuckoos and mynah birds;  
always chirping and growling,[^4] they’re  
beautifying my hermitage. (3) \[4301\]

Cuckoos[^5] with their lovely voices  
and swans[^6] with their honey-sweet tones  
are \[always\] singing their songs[^7] there,  
beautifying my hermitage. (4) \[4302\]

Lions, tigers and wild boars \[too\],  
wolves,[^8] \[more\] wolves,[^9] *kara bānā* bears,[^10]  
roar[^11] even on bad mountain roads,[^12]  
beautifying my hermitage. (5) \[4303\]

*Eṇi-*deer[^13] and *sarabha-*deer,[^14]  
jackals[^15] and many hogs[^16] \[as well\],  
cry[^17] even on bad mountain roads,[^18]  
beautifying my hermitage. (6) \[4304\]

Golden shower[^19] and champak \[trees\],[^20]  
trumpet-flower*,*[^21] Chinese chaste trees,[^22]  
hiptage[^23] vines and ashoka trees[^24]  
are blooming in my hermitage. (7) \[4305\]

Sage-leaf alangium,[^25] jasmine,[^26]  
*sattali,*[^27] *bimbijālika,*[^28]  
*kaṇṇikā* and dinner-plate trees[^29]  
are blooming in my hermitage. (8) \[4306\]

Ironwood,[^30] *sal*[^31] and *salalā,*[^32]  
white lotuses in bloom are here;  
wafting divine fragrances, they’re  
beautifying my hermitage. (9) \[4307\]

Arjuna[^33] and silver greywood,[^34]  
flowering sugarcane[^35] is here,  
*sal*[^36] and *kaṅgu*[^37]-flowers \[too, are\]  
beautifying my hermitage. (10) \[4308\]

Mango,[^38] rose-apple,[^39] coral-bean  
tree*,*[^40] neem,[^41] and *sāla-kalyāṇi,*[^42]  
wafting divine fragrances are  
beautifying my hermitage. (11) \[4309\]

Ashoka[^43] and wood-apple[^44] \[trees\],  
blooming *bhaginimāla* here,  
wafting divine fragrances are  
beautifying my hermitage. (12) \[4310\]

Kadam[^45] and banana[^46] \[trees\] and  
*isimugga*[^47] are planted \[there\].  
They bear fruit continuously,  
beautifying my hermitage. (13) \[4311\]

Myrobalan[^48] \[and\] gooseberry,[^49]  
mango,[^50] rose-apple,[^51] bahera,[^52]  
jujube,[^53] markingnut,[^54] bel[^55]  
are fruiting in my hermitage. (14) \[4312\]

Near \[the hermitage\] there’s a pond,  
with good bathing-fords, beautiful,  
covered with *mandālaka* blooms[^56]  
and with pink and blue lotuses.[^57] (15) \[4313\]

Pink lotuses germinate there;  
others, flowering, make pollen.  
*Kaṇṇika* trees with fallen leaves[^58]  
are blooming in my hermitage. (16) \[4314\]

Sheatfish,[^59] \[also\] *pāvusa*[^60] fish*,*  
*valaja,*[^61] reed-fish[^62] \[and\] red-fish[^63]  
are swimming[^64] in the clear water,  
beautifying my hermitage. (17) \[4315\]

Shrubs like *nayita, ambagandhi,*  
and screw-pine,[^65] suited \[to water\],  
wafting divine fragrances are  
beautifying my hermitage. (18) \[4316\]

Honey is flowing from the roots  
\[and\] milk \[and\] oil[^66] \[flow\] from the stems;  
wafting divine fragrances, they’re  
beautifying my hermitage. (19) \[4317\]

The sand that’s there is beautiful,  
strewn about beside the water.[^67]  
Young buds[^68] are[^69] \[always\] blossoming,  
beautifying my hermitage. (20) \[4318\]

Those bearing weights of matted hair,[^70]  
who wear deer-leather outer robes,  
dressed in garments made of bark, are  
beautifying my hermitage. (21) \[4319\]

Looking but a plough’s length ahead,[^71]  
clever \[and\] living peacefully,  
not looking to indulge[^72] in lust,  
they’re living in my hermitage. (22) \[4320\]

With nails and armpit hair grown long,  
muck in \[their\] teeth, heads \[soiled\] with dirt,  
all dressed in muddy dirt-smeared robes,[^73]  
they’re living in my hermitage. (23) \[4321\]

\[Six\] special knowledge-perfecters,[^74]  
they \[all\] can travel in the air.  
They’re rising up into the sky,  
beautifying my hermitage. (24) \[4322\]

Surrounded by those students, I  
am living in the forest then.  
I do not know the day from night,  
always doing meditation.[^75] (25) \[4323\]

The Buddha[^76] in that period  
was Atthadassi, the Great Sage.  
Doing away with the darkness,  
the Leader of the World arose. (26) \[4324\]

At that time a certain student  
arrived \[there\] at my hermitage,[^77]  
wanting to ask for secret spells,[^78]  
the six branches, \[reading of\] marks. (27) \[4325\]

“A Buddha’s[^79] risen in the world,  
the Great Sage \[named\] Atthadassi;  
explaining the Four Noble Truths,  
he’s declaring the deathless path.” (28) \[4326\]

Thrilled, \[my\] hair on end in delight,[^80]  
hoping to enter[^81] the Teaching,  
going out from the hermitage,  
I spoke these words \[to my students\]: (29) \[4327\]

“A Buddha’s risen in the world,  
Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks.  
Come, all of you, let us \[now\] go  
into the Great Sambuddha’s midst.” (30) \[4328\]

They \[all then\] followed \[my\] advice,  
perfected in the great Teaching.  
Seekers of ultimate meaning,  
they agreed, saying, “Excellent!” (31) \[4329\]

Those bearing weights of matted hair,[^82]  
wearing deer-leather outer robes,  
searching for ultimate meaning,  
then departed from the forest. (32) \[4330\]

The Buddha[^83] in that period  
was Atthadassi, of Great Fame.  
Explaining the Four Noble Truths,  
he’s declaring the deathless path. (33) \[4331\]

Taking a white umbrella, I  
carried it for the Best Buddha.  
Carrying it for one \[whole\] day,  
I \[then\] worshipped the Best Buddha. (34) \[4332\]

Atthadassi, the Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly,  
spoke these verses \[about me then\]: (35) \[4333\]

“Who bore this umbrella for me,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by his own hands,  
I shall relate details of him:  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (36) \[4334\]

When\[ever\] this one is reborn,  
\[whether\] as a god or human,  
umbrellas[^84] will be borne for him:  
the fruit of giving umbrellas. (37) \[4335\]

For seventy-seven aeons  
he’ll delight in the world of gods.  
A thousand times he’ll be a king,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (38) \[4336\]

Seventy-seven times as well,  
he will exercise divine rule,  
\[and there will be\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (39) \[4337\]

Eighteen hundred aeons \[from now,\]  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyas,  
doing away with the darkness,  
will arise, the One with \[Five\] Eyes. (40) \[4338\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (41) \[4339\]

Since I was that karma-doer,  
bearing the Buddha’s umbrella,  
\[right\] up to now I do not know  
a white umbrella not carried. (42) \[4340\]

This is the final time for me;  
\[my\] last rebirth is proceeding;[^85]  
today umbrella-carrying  
is happening all of the time. (43) \[4341\]

O! My karma was well-done for  
Atthadassi, the Neutral One.  
All defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (44) \[4342\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (45) \[4343\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (46) \[4344\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (47) \[4345\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekachattiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ekachattiya Thera is finished.

    \[6332\] the gloss is a straightforward *helmäli* = edible white
    water-lily, Nymphaea Lotus. But elsewhere BJTS gives different
    glosses: at \[4007\] BJTS glosses it as *madāra* tree
    \[mountain-ebony, Bauhinia purpurea (*Legum.*)\] and says the
    blossoms fell into the water from overhanging trees. BJTS gloss at
    \[324\] is “a water-born plant named *Mandālā”.* At \[171\] BJTS
    Sinh. gloss is *taḍāgayangen*, “from the moss,” following its
