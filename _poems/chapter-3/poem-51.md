*Vījanī Chapter, the Sixth*

*\[51. Vidhūpanadāyaka*[^1]*\]*

I dedicated a fan to

Padumuttara the Buddha,

the World’s Best One, the Neutral One,

the Such-Like Lord of \[all\] Bipeds. (1) \[1258\]

Bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart,

pressing both my hands together,

having worshipped the Sambuddha,

I departed facing the north. (2) \[1259\]

Picking up the fan \[I gave him\]

the Teacher, the World’s Chief Leader;

standing in the monks’ Assembly

\[then\] spoke these verses \[about me\]: (3) \[1260\]

“Because of this gift of a fan

\[and\] the resolve in \[his own\] heart,

for one hundred thousand aeons

\[he\] won’t go to a place of grief. (4) \[1261\]

Resolved, with strenuous effort,

attentive to the heart’s virtue,

he will attain arahantship

when he’s \[only\] seven years \[old\]. (5) \[1262\]

In sixty thousand aeons \[hence\]

he will be sixteen \[different\] kings

who’ll \[all\] be named Vijamāna,[^2]

wheel-turning monarchs with great strength.” (6) \[1263\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1264\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vidhūpanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Vidhūpanadāyaka Thera is finished.
