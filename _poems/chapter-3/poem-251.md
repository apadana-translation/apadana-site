## Thomaka Chapter, the Twenty-Sixth

### \[251. Thomadāyaka[^1]\]

Standing[^2] in the world of the gods,  
having listened to the Teaching[^3]  
of Vipassi \[Buddha\], Great Sage,  
satisfied[^4] I uttered these words:[^5] (1) \[2499\]

“Praise to you, O Well-Bred Person![^6]  
Praise to you, Ultimate Person!  
\[While\] explaining the deathless state  
you ferry many folks across.” (2) \[2500\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I uttered that speech at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[speaking\] praises. (3) \[2501\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2502\]

Thus indeed Venerable Thomadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Thomadāyaka Thera is finished.
