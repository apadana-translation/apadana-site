### \[270. Taraṇiya[^1]\]

Vipassi Buddha,[^2] Golden One,  
was standing on a river bank,  
Worthy of Homage, the Teacher,  
Honored by the Monks’ Assembly. (1) \[2578\]

Boats for crossing the great ocean  
were not to be found in that place.  
Having gone forth from \[that\] river  
I helped the World’s Leader across.[^3] (2) \[2579\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I helped the Best Person to cross,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of ferrying. (3) \[2580\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2581\]

Thus indeed Venerable Taraṇiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Taraṇiya Thera is finished.

The Summary:

Ukkhepi, Tela and Candi,  
Dipada and Biḷālida,  
Maccha, Java, Salaḷada,  
Rakkhasa, Taraṇa \[makes\] ten  
and here the verses are counted  
as exactly forty plus one.

[^1]: “Boatman” or “Ferryman.” cf. \#204, \#280, \#485 {488}. Perhaps in this instance better, “Cross-Over-er” since it is not clear just how he performs the deed. Are we to imagine him as a fish?

[^2]: lit., Sambuddha

[^3]: lit., “I caused the World’s Leader to cross”
