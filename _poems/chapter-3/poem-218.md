*\[218. Akkantasaññaka*[^1]*\]*  
In the past I, having taken  
a crude cloak to \[my\] preceptor,  
I am studying a *mantra*  
to split arrows with an arrow. (1) \[2355\]

I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the Chief, Superb, Bull among Men,  
Tissa Buddha, Best Elephant. (2) \[2356\]

That crude cloak was spread out \[by me\]  
for the Best Man, who was walking,[^2]  
the Lofty One, the Great Hero,  
the World’s Best, the Bull of Men. (3) \[2357\]

Having seen that Lamp of the World,  
who was Flawless, the Moon-like One,  
I \[then\] worshipped the Teacher’s feet,  
with a mind \[which was\] very clear. (4) \[2358\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave that crude cloak \[to Buddha\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of \[giving\] a crude cloak. (5) \[2359\]

In the thirty-seventh aeon  
hence there was one lord of people,  
known by the name of Sunanda,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (6) \[2360\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[2361\]

Thus indeed Venerable Akkantasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Akkantasaññaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Perceiver of Walking”  
[^2]: BJTS appropriately explains that he was doing walking meditation  
[^3]: “Good Joy”
