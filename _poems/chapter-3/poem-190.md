### \[190. Tivaṇṭipupphiya[^1]\]

All of them, gathered together,  
are looking at me, overwhelmed.[^2]  
Burning was produced \[in the minds\][^3]  
of those \[people\] who are looking. (1) \[2208\]

At that time a follower of  
Buddha Dhammadassi, the Sage,  
known by the name of Sunanda[^4]  
came into my vicinity. (2) \[2209\]

Those who were my associates[^5]  
gave me a flower at that time.  
Taking that flower \[they’d given,\]  
I gave it to the follower. (3) \[2210\]

I passed away \[right\] on the spot  
\[and then\] was reborn yet again.  
In eighteen hundred aeons \[hence\]  
I went into no place of grief. (4) \[2211\]

In the thirteen hundredth aeon,  
there were eight Dhūmaketunas,[^6]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength,  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[2212\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2213\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tivaṇṭipupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tivaṇṭipupphiya Thera is finished.

The Kuṭajapupphiya Chapter, the Nineteenth.

[^1]: “Three Flower Stalks \[Donor\]”

[^2]: the cty does not explain the reason he is overwhelmed (or overpowered: *abhibhuŋ*).

[^3]: this translation follows the BJTS gloss

[^4]: “Good Joy”

[^5]: *paddha<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>arā*; BJTS reads *bhaddha<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>arā*. Elsewhere (see below, \#194, v. 1 \[2230\]) cty glosses the term as “servant” which is also possible; this reading follows BJTS which glosses it as *saha<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>arayo*, associates or fellow-wanders.

[^6]: that is, he was reborn eight times as a \[king\] named Dhūmaketana. The name means “Having fire \[or smoke\] on \[or as\] \[his\] banner \[or flag\]”

[^7]: reading *dvāsaṭṭhi* with BJTS for PTS *bāsaṭṭhi* (though *bā-* is a common alternative for *dvā-* in compounds)
