### \[147. Maggadāyaka[^1]\]

The Eyeful One went in the forest  
after \[he had\] crossed a river.  
I saw Siddhattha,[^2] Sambuddha,  
Bearing \[all\] the Excellent Marks. (1) \[1972\]

Carrying a hoe[^3] and basket  
I \[then\] made that pathway level,  
and having worshipped the Teacher,  
I brought \[my\] own heart \[great\] pleasure. (2) \[1973\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving a road. (3) \[1974\]

In the fifty-seventh aeon,  
there was one person at the top;  
he was a lord, ruler of men,  
\[who\] was known as Suppabuddha.[^4] (4) \[1975\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1976\]

Thus indeed Venerable Maggadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Maggadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Road-Donor”

[^2]: PTS has mistakenly made the “t”’s in the name retroflex; I follow BJTS in providing the correct spelling.

[^3]: *kuddāla* is the particularly South Asian version of the hoe, Sinhala *udälla*.

[^4]: “Well-Awakened”
