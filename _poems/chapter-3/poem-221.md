*Ālambanadāyaka Chapter, the Twenty-Third*  
*\[221. Ālambanadāyaka*[^1]*\]*  
I gave a plank for hanging \[things\]  
to the Biped Lord, Neutral One,  
the Blessed One, Atthadassi,  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One. (1) \[2373\]  
I am ruling[^2] the massive earth  
\[together with\] the sea and sky.  
I exercise[^3] overlordship  
among \[all\] creatures[^4] on the earth. (2) \[2374\]  
My defilements are \[all\] burnt up,  
every existence is canceled.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2375\]  
In the sixty-second aeon  
hence were three of the royal caste,[^5]  
\[all were\] named Ekāpassita,[^6]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (4) \[2376\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2377\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Ālambanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Ālambanadāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Donor of a Plank for Hanging \[Things On\]”  
[^2]: lit., “entering”. I follow the BJTS Sinhala gloss in this reading.  
[^3]: lit., carry on  
[^4]: lit., “things that breathe”  
[^5]: lit., “kṣatriyans”  
[^6]: “Leaning on One” -- reading the name as *eka* + *apassita* (RD:
    fr. apasseti, leaning against, depending on, trusting in), perhaps
    meant to be resonant with the donated wall-hooks
