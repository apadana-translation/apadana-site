### \[527. {530.}[^1] Sugandha[^2]\]

In this \[present\] lucky aeon  
Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,  
named Kassapa through \[his\] lineage,[^3]  
Best Debater,[^4] \[Buddha\] arose. (1) \[5617\][^5]

Possessing Eighty Lesser Marks,  
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks,  
Having[^6] a Fathom-Wide Aura,  
Gone into a Net of Light-Rays,[^7] (2) \[5618\]

as Comforting[^8] as is the moon,  
Maker of Light \[just\] like the sun,  
Quenching \[just\] as does a raincloud,  
a Mine of Gems like the ocean, (3) \[5619\]

Through morals like earth; through wisdom  
like the sky; through meditation[^9]  
like Himalaya; like the wind  
\[he does\] not stick to anything. (4) \[5620\]

At one time he, the Sage So Great,  
Confident among Multitudes,[^10]  
is explaining the \[Noble\] Truths,  
\[and\] lifting up the populace. (5) \[5621\]

I was then a millionaire’s son  
in Benares, very famous.  
Back then I was the master[^11] of  
considerable wealth and grain. (6) \[5622\]

\[While\] wandering about on foot,  
I came up to the “Deer-Park”[^12] \[grove\].  
There I saw the such-like Buddha,  
\[who was\] preaching the deathless state,  
in distinct \[and\] delightful words,  
with the \[sweet\] tone of a cuckoo,  
with the noise of a swan \[or\] drum,  
making the people understand. (7-8) \[5623-5624\]

Having seen that God Above Gods,  
and hearing his honey\[-sweet\] words,  
having abandoned no small wealth,  
I went forth into homelessness. (9) \[5625\]

Thus gone forth, in not a long time,  
being a very learned \[monk\],  
I became a *Dhamma*-preacher,  
having diverse intelligence. (10) \[5626\]

Amidst large multitudes I \[then\],  
happy-hearted, repeatedly,[^13]  
extolled the Buddha’s gold color,  
skilled at extolling \[his\] beauty:[^14] (11) \[5627\]

“This is Buddha, the Undefiled,[^15]  
Unconfused One,[^16] With Doubt Cut Out,[^17]  
he whose Karma is All Destroyed,[^18]  
Freed in the End of Conditions.[^19] (12) \[5628\]

This is Buddha, the Blessed One;  
he’s the Unsurpassed, the Lion,  
the Turner of the Brahma-wheel[^20]  
for the world including the gods; (13) \[5629\]

Tame, the Tamer, the Peaceful One,  
the Appeaser,[^21] Blown Out,[^22] the Sage,[^23]  
the Quencher[^24] and the Comforted,[^25]  
the Comforter[^26] of the people; (14) \[5630\]

The Hero, the God, the Wise One,  
Wisdom, Compassionate, Master,  
the Conqueror, and the Victor,  
Not Being Reborn,[^27] Homeless One;[^28] (15) \[5631\]

Lust-less One,[^29] Unshaking, Smart One,[^30]  
Undeluded, Unequaled,[^31] Sage,[^32]  
Yoke-Bearer,[^33] Bull, the Elephant,  
Lion, Indra[^34] among gurus; (16) \[5632\]

Passionless One,[^35] Stainless One,[^36] God,[^37]  
God of Speakers,[^38] Fault-Renouncer,[^39]  
Unobstructed[^40] and Free of Grief,[^41]  
Unequaled,[^42] Restrained,[^43] the Pure One;[^44] (17) \[5633\]

the Brahmin,[^45] the Monk[^46] \[and\] the Lord,[^47]  
the Physician[^48] \[and\] the Surgeon,[^49]  
Warrior,[^50] Buddha, Sacred Lore,[^51]  
Unshaking,[^52] the Glad One,[^53] the Free;[^54] (18) \[5634\]

Upholder,[^55] Ready,[^56] the Slayer,[^57]  
the Doer,[^58] the Guide,[^59] Explainer,[^60]  
the Gladdener,[^61] the Enjoyer,[^62]  
the Cutter,[^63] the Hearer,[^64] the Praised;[^65] (19) \[5635\]

Unobstructed[^66] and Extensive,[^67]  
Unconfused One,[^68] Not Uncertain,[^69]  
Lust-less,[^70] Unstained,[^71] the Companion,[^72]  
Goer,[^73] the Speaker,[^74] Explainer;[^75] (20) \[5636\]

the Crosser,[^76] the Meaning-Maker,[^77]  
the Builder,[^78] \[also\] the Tearer,[^79]  
Attainer,[^80] Bearer,[^81] Beloved,[^82]  
Slayer,[^83] Energetic,[^84] Ascetic,[^85] (21) \[5637\]

Even-Minded[^86] \[and\] Impartial,[^87]  
Self-Dependent,[^88] Home of Kindness,[^89]  
Wonderfully Peaceful,[^90] Honest,[^91]  
Doer of the Deed,[^92] Seventh Sage;[^93] (22) \[5638\]

Crossed Beyond Doubt,[^94] Free of Conceit,[^95]  
the Boundless One,[^96] Beyond Compare,[^97]  
Traveled the Roads of All Sayings,[^98]  
Attained the Truth to Know,[^99] Victor.[^100] (23) \[5639\]

\[Buddha’s\] palace brings deathlessness  
in the best hardwood of beings;[^101]  
the powerful have faith in the  
Buddha, Teaching and Assembly.” (24) \[5640\]

By means of virtues such as these,  
I did \[my\] preaching of *Dhamma*,[^102]  
praising amidst the multitudes  
the Three Worlds’ Unsurpassed Refuge. (25) \[5641\]

Falling from there, in Tusitā,  
having enjoyed great happiness,  
falling from there, among people,  
I’m born with a very good scent. (26) \[5642\]

My wind,[^103] the fragrance of my mouth,  
likewise too \[my\] body odor,  
and the scent of \[my\] sweat, always  
surpasses[^104] all \[other\] perfumes. (27) \[5643\]

My mouth-fragrance always is of  
pink \[and\] blue lotus and jasmine.  
And so too my body\[-odor\],  
always blowing very calmly.[^105] (28) \[5644\]

All of you, minds concentrated,  
listen to my \[words\], I’ll extol  
all of that most amazing fruit  
for one who \[praised\] virtue’s value.[^106] (29) \[5645\]

Having told the Buddha’s virtues  
with kindness when people gather,  
bound up with a honey-sweet sound,[^107]  
I am happy in every place, (30) \[5646\]

famous, happy, \[also\] held dear,  
splendorous, lovely to look at,  
a speaker, not disregarded,  
free of faults and also \[most\] wise. (31) \[5647\]

When life ends,[^108] nirvana’s easy  
to reach for Buddha’s devotees.  
I’m telling the cause of their \[ease\];  
listen to that[^109] \[now\] truthfully: (32) \[5648\]

I saluted in due form the  
Blessed One’s fame for peacefulness.  
Because of that I am famous[^110]  
\[when\] I am reborn here and there. (33) \[5649\]

\[I\] am happy because[^111] I praised  
the Buddha who ends suffering,[^112]  
\[and\] peaceful, unconditioned Truth,[^113]  
giving happiness to beings. (34) \[5650\]

Declaring the Buddha’s virtue,  
bound up with joy in the Buddha,  
I made[^114] \[him\] dear to self and to  
others; therefore I am held dear. (35) \[5651\]

Overcoming evil rivals[^115]  
in the rival-strewn[^116] people-flood,  
praising[^117] virtue I lit up the  
Leader; therefore I’m splendorous. (36) \[5652\]

Telling[^118] the Sambuddha’s virtue,  
I made him lovely to people,[^119]  
as is the moon in the autumn;[^120]  
therefore I’m[^121] lovely to look at. (37) \[5653\]

With all \[my\] words I praised Buddha,[^122]  
to the extent \[I\] was able;[^123]  
therefore I speak eloquently,[^124]  
\[and\] have diverse intelligence. (38) \[5654\]

With the great Teaching I restrained  
those fools who, afflicted with doubt,[^125]  
treat the Sage So Great with contempt;  
therefore I’m not disregarded. (39) \[5655\]

Through the virtues of the Buddha,  
I drove[^126] out beings’ defilements.  
I am \[now\] free of defilements,  
as a result of that karma. (40) \[5656\]

A preacher who recalls Buddha,  
I brought Buddha to listeners.  
Therefore I’m endowed with wisdom,  
contemplating subtle meanings. (41) \[5657\]

All \[my\] defilements are destroyed;  
\[I’ve\] crossed the ocean of being.[^127]  
Like fire, \[I\] have no attachments;  
I will realize nirvana. (42) \[5658\]

Within just this \[present\] aeon  
since I \[thus\] praised \[him\], the Buddha,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of praising Buddhas. (43) \[5659\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (44) \[5660\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (45) \[5661\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (46) \[5662\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sugandha Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sugandha Thera is finished.
