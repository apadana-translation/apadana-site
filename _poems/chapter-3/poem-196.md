### \[196. Kisalayapūjaka[^1]\]

In the city, Dvāravatī,  
I had a small flowering tree.[^2]  
There was a well there \[in that place,\]  
\[whose water\] made the trees grow tall.[^3] (1) \[2241\]

Siddhattha, the Unconquered One,  
made firm by \[his\] own \[mental\][^4] strength,  
showing \[his\] compassion for me,  
traveled in the path of the wind.[^5] (2) \[2242\]

I am looking at nothing else,  
fixed on worship of the Great Sage.  
Seeing an ashoka tree sprout  
I threw it up into the sky. (3) \[2243\]

Those shoots are going backwards  
to the Buddha going \[in the sky\].  
That I, seeing that miracle,  
\[thought\], “O! The Buddha’s loftiness!”[^6] (4) \[2244\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I offered \[the Buddha\] that sprout,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (5) \[2245\]

In the twenty-seventh aeon  
ago lived one Ekassara,[^7]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (6) \[2246\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[2247\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kisalayapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kisalayapūjaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Offerer of a Tender Sprout (or Shoot)”

[^2]: lit., “there was a small flowering tree (or shrub) of mine”

[^3]: lit., “making grow up of the trees,” apposite “well”

[^4]: see above, \#189, v. 2 (BJTS 2203)

[^5]: BJTS gloss makes clear: out of compassion he demonstrated his Buddha powers by flying through the sky for a moment.

[^6]: reading *uḷāratā* with BJTS for PTS *pūjaka* (“offerer”). The latter reading -- which is also possible -- would mean that his amazement was at the fact that his *pūjā* resulted in his seeing the miracle, rather than the miracle itself (the *iddhi* powers of a Buddha).

[^7]: the name means “One Mule,” which seems rather diminutive for a world-conquering monarch. Both PTS and BJTS give alternate reading Ekissaro, “One Lord,” which would seem more appropriate, but both accept Ekassara as the preferred reading based on the manuscript record.
