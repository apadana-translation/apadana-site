*\[526. {529.}*[^1] *Āmaṇḍaphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
The Victor, Padumuttara,  
was a Master of Everything.  
RIsing up from meditation,[^3]  
the World-Leader walked back and forth. (1) \[5611\]

Having taken a *khāri-*load,  
I was carrying fruit \[just\] then.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
the Great Sage, walking back and forth. (2) \[5612\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
hands pressed together on \[my\] head,  
saluting \[him\], the Sambuddha,  
I gave \[him\] a castor-oil fruit.[^4] (3) \[5613\]

In the hundred thousand aeons,  
since I gave that fruit at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of castor-oil \[fruit\]. (4) \[5614\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[5615\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5616\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[5617\]

Thus indeed Venerable Āmaṇḍaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Āmaṇḍaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “*Āmaṇḍa-*Fruit Donor”  
[^3]: lit., “from *samādhi*”  
[^4]: *āmaṇḍaṃ,* which PSI defines as “a kind of plant, *Palma
    Christi*,” Sinhala *eraṇḍu*. The latter (also *ēraṇḍu*, Pāli
    *eraṇḍa) = datti,* croton, i.e., (see Cone, s.v.) the castor oil
    plant (Ricinus communis, the seeds of which are used to make an
    oil). BJTS gloss gives *kaekiri* on v. \[1187\], which is something
    like a cucumber (genera Cucumis), which I suspect is wrong; here a
    footnote on the SInh. gloss of v. \[5613\] questions *mas komaḍu?
    eraṇḍu?* (“watermelon? castor oil plant?”). Whatever the identity of
    the fruit, the point is that the protagonist gave the Buddha one of
    the fruits he was carrying.
