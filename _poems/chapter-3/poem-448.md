*\[445. {448.}*[^1] *Pādapīṭhiya*[^2]*\]*  
The Sambuddha named Sumedha,  
the Chief, Compassionate, the Sage,  
causing many beings to cross,  
\[then\] reached nirvana, Great-Famed One. (1) \[4766\]  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I had a stool for the feet made  
close to the lion-throne of him,  
of Sumedha, the Sage So Great. (2) \[4767\]  
Doing that wholesome karma which  
bears fruit and leads to happiness,[^3]  
conforming to \[my\] good[^4] karma,  
I \[then\] went to Tāvatiṃsa. (3) \[4768\]  
When I was living in that \[world,\]  
being endowed with good[^5] karma,  
when lifting up \[my\] feet a gold  
footstool \[then\] comes to be for me. (4) \[4769\]  
The gain for them is well-received,  
who are getting a listening;  
serving[^6] \[Buddha\] in nirvana,[^7]  
they’re receiving huge happiness. (5) \[4770\]  
My karma too was so well done,  
\[carefully\] employing merchants.  
After having a footstool made,  
I’m receiving a chair of gold. (6) \[4771\]  
Whichever direction I go,[^8]  
for any reason at all, I’m  
stepping on a stool of gold:  
that is the fruit of good[^9] karma. (7) \[4772\]  
In the thirty thousand aeons  
since I did that karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of a footstool. (8) \[4773\]  
My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (9) \[4774\]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[4775\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[4776\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Pādapīṭhiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Pādapīṭhiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “Footstool-er”  
[^3]: *sukhapākaŋ sukhūdāyaŋ,* ‘whose fruit is happiness, which leads to
    happiness.” Not that I accept the BJTS reading *sukhūdāyaṃ*
    (“leading to happiness”) for PTS *sukhindriyaŋ,* “wwith happy senses
    ith happy senses,” though the latter could appropriately be taken as
    an adverb qualifying *katvāna,* i.e., “doing wholsesome karma”  
[^4]: lit., “meritorious”
