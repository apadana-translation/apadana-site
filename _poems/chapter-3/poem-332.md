### {\*332, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> only: Udakapūjaka[^1]}[^2]

\[I saw\] the Golden Sambuddha  
going in the path of the wind,  
glistening like an oil-altar,[^3]  
blazing up like a fire-altar.[^4] \[2937\]

Taking \[some\] water with my hand,  
I tossed it up into the sky.  
The Buddha, Compassionate, Sage,  
Great Hero, \[then\] accepted it. \[2938\]

Standing in the sky, the Teacher,  
whose name was Padumuttara,  
discerning what I was thinking,  
spoke this verse \[about me just then\]: \[2939\]

“Because of this gift of water  
and the joy that \[he\] produced \[then\],  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
he’ll come to know no bad rebirth.” \[2940\]

Due to that deed for Buddha,[^5]  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state  
beyond \[all\] conquest and defeat. \[2941\]

In the sixty-five hundredth aeon,  
there were three wheel-turning monarchs;  
\[all were\] named Sahassarāja,[^6]  
lords over people on four sides. \[2942\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[2943\]

Thus indeed Venerable Udakapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Udakapūjaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Water-Offer-er” This *apadāna*, apparently supplied to fulfill the colophonic expectation of an *apadāna* so-named at this juncture in the text, precisely duplicates \#106, already given above (verses \[1639-1645\]).

[^2]: up to this point in the whole *Apadāna* text as received, save a few extra verses in the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition of the *Buddhāpadāna*, and minor variants in individual verses which in this translation are regularly noted in footnotes and sometimes accepted over the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition, the two editions I am following in this translation (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> based on Sinhala mss., <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> based on Burmese ones) have been virtually identical. At this juncture, however, the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition is based on mss. which all omit three *apadānas* in the *Gandhathūpiya* (*Gandhodaka*) chapter, providing only seven *apadānas* rather than the expected ten (see <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> p. 276). That this is a fault of the manuscripts becomes clear given that the standard colophonic chapter summary (*uddāna*), even in the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition/mss., lists ten *apadānas* in this chapter. The names in that chapter summary support the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> inclusion at this juncture of the three additional *apadānas* which *are* found in the mss. upon which it is based. Though <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> gives *Phussitakammiya* (*Phusitakampiya*) as \#332, in the chapter summary’s view it should be — and in the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition it is — \#335. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> thus numbers the present *apadāna*, not found in <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>, \#332. In order to continue translating both texts side by side I insert the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> poem numbers in {fancy brackets}. Hereafter, when the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> numbering resumes (with <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> \#332 = <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> \#335), the corresponding <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> *apadāna* numbers are likewise provided in {fancy brackets} beside the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> numbers in the heading of each poem. These latter, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> numbers maintain the base-ten structure of the editors, unlike those of the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>.

[^3]: *ghata-āsana*, presumably where oil oblations are made

[^4]: *huta-āsana*, where sacrifices are offered into the fire

[^5]: lit., "for the Biped-Lord”

[^6]: “Thousand Kings”
