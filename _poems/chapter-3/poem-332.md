### {\*332, BJTS only: Udakapūjaka[^1]}[^2]

\[I saw\] the Golden Sambuddha  
going in the path of the wind,  
glistening like an oil-altar,[^3]  
blazing up like a fire-altar.[^4] \[2937\]

Taking \[some\] water with my hand,  
I tossed it up into the sky.  
The Buddha, Compassionate, Sage,  
Great Hero, \[then\] accepted it. \[2938\]

Standing in the sky, the Teacher,  
whose name was Padumuttara,  
discerning what I was thinking,  
spoke this verse \[about me just then\]: \[2939\]

“Because of this gift of water  
and the joy that \[he\] produced \[then\],  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
he’ll come to know no bad rebirth.” \[2940\]

Due to that deed for Buddha,[^5]  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state  
beyond \[all\] conquest and defeat. \[2941\]

In the sixty-five hundredth aeon,  
there were three wheel-turning monarchs;  
\[all were\] named Sahassarāja,[^6]  
lords over people on four sides. \[2942\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[2943\]

Thus indeed Venerable Udakapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Udakapūjaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Water-Offer-er” This *apadāna*, apparently supplied to fulfill the colophonic expectation of an *apadāna* so-named at this juncture in the text, precisely duplicates \#106, already given above (verses \[1639-1645\]).

[^2]: up to this point in the whole *Apadāna* text as received, save a few extra verses in the BJTS edition of the *Buddhāpadāna*, and minor variants in individual verses which in this translation are regularly noted in footnotes and sometimes accepted over the PTS edition, the two editions I am following in this translation (BJTS based on Sinhala mss., PTS based on Burmese ones) have been virtually identical. At this juncture, however, the PTS edition is based on mss. which all omit three *apadānas* in the *Gandhathūpiya* (*Gandhodaka*) chapter, providing only seven *apadānas* rather than the expected ten (see PTS p. 276). That this is a fault of the manuscripts becomes clear given that the standard colophonic chapter summary (*uddāna*), even in the PTS edition/mss., lists ten *apadānas* in this chapter. The names in that chapter summary support the BJTS inclusion at this juncture of the three additional *apadānas* which *are* found in the mss. upon which it is based. Though PTS gives *Phussitakammiya* (*Phusitakampiya*) as \#332, in the chapter summary’s view it should be — and in the BJTS edition it is — \#335. BJTS thus numbers the present *apadāna*, not found in PTS, \#332. In order to continue translating both texts side by side I insert the BJTS poem numbers in {fancy brackets}. Hereafter, when the PTS numbering resumes (with PTS \#332 = BJTS \#335), the corresponding BJTS *apadāna* numbers are likewise provided in {fancy brackets} beside the PTS numbers in the heading of each poem. These latter, BJTS numbers maintain the base-ten structure of the editors, unlike those of the PTS.

[^3]: *ghata-āsana*, presumably where oil oblations are made

[^4]: *huta-āsana*, where sacrifices are offered into the fire

[^5]: lit., "for the Biped-Lord”

[^6]: “Thousand Kings”
