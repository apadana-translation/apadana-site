### \[402. {405.}[^1] Upasīva[^2]\]

In the Himalayan region,  
there’s a mountain named Anoma.  
My well-made hermitage \[is there\],  
\[with\] halls well-constructed of leaves. (1) \[3990\]

And a river is flowing there,  
beautiful, with excellent banks,  
\[and\] along \[those\] banks[^3] are growing  
many pink and blue lotuses. (2) \[3991\]

\[That\] river is flowing back then,  
covered with fish and tortoises,  
sheatfish,[^4] *pāvusa*,[^5] *valaja*,[^6]  
reed-fish,[^7] red-fish[^8] \[and\] *maggura*.[^9] (3) \[3992\]

*Timira* \[trees\] are blooming there,  
ashoka,[^10] *khuddamālaka*,[^11]  
laurel,[^12] and mountain laurel[^13] trees  
are perfuming my hermitage. (4) \[3993\]

Winter cherry[^14] is blooming there,  
and forests of Arab jasmine;[^15]  
*sal*[^16] and *salalā*[^17] \[trees\] are there,  
and lots of blooming *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampaka*.[^18] (5) \[3994\]

Arjuna \[trees\][^19] and hiptage vines,[^20]  
and sugarcane[^21] are blossoming;  
silver greywood,[^22] *madhugandhi*,[^23]  
blossoming in my hermitage. (6) \[3995\]

Half a league on every side is  
covered with *bimbijālika*,[^24]  
golden shower,[^25] trumpet-flower,[^26]  
jasmine,[^27] also *piyaṅguka*.[^28] (7) \[3996\]

*Mātaṅgava* and *sattali*[^29]  
trumpet-flower,[^30] Chinese chaste tree,[^31]  
much sage-leaf alangium[^32] there,  
\[and\] *tālakūṭa*[^33] blossoming. (8) \[3997\]

There is much *sāleyyaka*[^34] there,  
blossoming in my hermitage.  
Many trees are beautiful when  
they are bursting into flower.  
On every side the scents of that  
are wafting through my hermitage. (9-10a-b) \[3998\][^35]

Myrobalan[^36] \[and\] gooseberry,[^37]  
mango,[^38] rose-apple,[^39] bahera,[^40]

as well as *phārusaka*[^44] fruits, (10c-d, 11a-b) \[3999\]

wild mangosteen,[^45] chirauli-nut,[^46]  
mahuwa[^47] and *kāsumārī*,[^48]  
breadfruit[^49] \[and\] jak[^50] \[are growing\] there,  
bananas[^51] \[and\] jujube fruits,[^52] (11c-d, 12a-b) \[4000\]

large quantities of hog-plum[^53] there,  
as well as *vallikāra*[^54] fruits,  
citron[^55] and *sapāriya*[^56] \[trees\]  
are blooming in my hermitage. (12c-d, 13a-b) \[4001\]

*Ālaka* and *isimugga*,[^57]  
after that lots of *moda*-fruit;[^58]  
all around,[^59] heavy with ripe fruit,[^60]  
are wave-leafed[^61] and glomerous[^62] figs. (13c-d, 14a-b) \[4002\]

Pepper,[^63] and black peppercorns[^64] there,  
banyan,[^65] also wood-apple trees,[^66]  
a lot of glomerous fig trees,[^67]  
*kaṇḍapakka* and *pārī* \[trees\]. (14c-d, 15a-b) \[4003\]

These and many other trees too  
are fruiting in my hermitage.  
Also many flowering trees,  
flowering in my hermitage. (15c-d, 16a-b) \[4004\]

Titan arum,[^68] also bindweed,[^69]  
*bilāni*, *takkaḷāni* \[bulbs\],  
*ālaka* and *tālaka* \[too\]  
are \[all\] found in my hermitage. (16c-d, 17a-b) \[4005\]

Close to[^70] that hermitage of mine,  
there was a large natural lake.  
\[It was\] beautiful, with good banks,  
cool water, \[crystal-\]clear water. (17c-d, 18a-b) \[4006\]

Many pink and blue lotuses  
are mixed with white lotuses there;  
covered with *mandālaka*[^71] blooms,  
it’s full of various \[good\] scents. (18c-d, 19a-b) \[4007\]

Pink lotuses germinate there;  
others, flowering, make pollen.  
Many pink lotus buds \[and\] leaves  
\[and\] pericarps[^72] float[^73] \[on that lake\]. (19c-d, 20a-b) \[4008\]

Honey flows from the lotus stems[^74]  
\[and\] milk \[and\] ghee[^75] from lotus roots.[^76]  
On all sides, with the scent of that,  
it’s full of various \[good\] scents. (20c-d, 21a-b) \[4009\]

White lotuses,[^77] *ambagandhī*,  
and many *nayita* are seen;  
as befits a natural lake,  
there’s a lot of screw-pine[^78] in bloom. (21c-d, 22a-b) \[4010\]

*Bandhujīva*[^79] in full flower,  
sweetly-scented[^80] *setavārī*,[^81]  
crocodiles[^82] and alligators[^83]  
\[and other\] fierce beasts[^84] are born there. (22c-d, 23a-b) \[4011\]

Many *uggāhas*[^85] \[and\] pythons[^86]  
\[live\] there in \[that\] natural lake;  
sheatfish,[^87] *pāvusa*,[^88] *valaja*,[^89]  
reed-fish,[^90] red-fish[^91] \[and\] *maggura*.[^92] (23c-d, 24a-b)
\[4012\]

\[It’s\] covered with fish and turtles,[^93]  
also with small, tailless monkeys;[^94]  
pigeons[^95] and *ravi*-swans[^96] \[as well\],  
wild jungle fowl,[^97] *nadī<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ara*\s, (24c-d, 25a-b) \[4013\]

wattled lapwings[^98] and ruddy geese,[^99]  
*<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ampakas*[^100] as well as pheasants,[^101]  
squirrels,[^102] \[also\] osprey[^103] \[and\] hawks,[^104]  
\[and\] many \[birds called\] *uddhara*, (25c-d, 26a-b) \[4014\]

paddy-birds,[^105] Ceylon lorikeets,[^106]  
crabs[^107] and many yak-oxen[^108] \[too\],  
*kāreṇiyas*[^109] and *tilakas*  
are \[then\] residing on that lake. (26c-d, 27a-b) \[4015\]

Lions and tigers and leopards,  
bears[^110] \[and\] wolves,[^111] *kara bānā* bears,[^112]  
monkeys,[^113] also even centaurs[^114]  
are seen inside my hermitage. (27c-d, 28a-b) \[4016\]

Smelling those \[sweetly-perfumed\] scents,  
feeding myself upon \[those\] fruits,  
drinking perfumed water, I am  
living \[there\] in my hermitage. (28c-d, 29a-b) \[4017\]

*Eṇi*-deer[^115] as well as wild boar,[^116]  
spotted deer,[^117] \[also\] smaller breeds,[^118]  
and *aggikas* \[and\] *jotikas*[^119]  
are living in my hermitage. (29c-d, 30a-b) \[4018\]

Swans[^120] \[and\] curlews[^121] and peacocks[^122] too,  
mynah birds[^123] and also cuckoos;[^124]  
there are many *mañjarikas*,[^125]  
owls[^126] and *poṭṭhasīsa*\s[^127] there. (30c-d, 31a-b) \[4019\]

There are goblins,[^128] also titans,[^129]  
many fairies,[^130] \[also\] demons,[^131]  
*garuḷa*\s, also snake-demons,[^132]  
living \[there\] in my hermitage. (31c-d, 32a-b) \[4020\]

Sages who possess great powers,[^133]  
peaceful-hearted \[and\] attentive,  
holding long-spouted waterpots,[^134]  
all wearing robes of deer-leather,  
wearing braids and \[carrying\] weights,[^135]  
are living in my hermitage. (32c-d, 33) \[4021\]

Looking but a plough’s length ahead,[^136]  
clever \[and\] living peacefully,  
happy if receiving or not,  
they’re living in my hermitage. (34) \[4022\]

Throwing off \[their\] clothes made of bark,  
rattling \[their\] deer-leather \[robes\],  
supported by \[just their\] own strength,  
they are then flying[^137] through the sky. (35) \[4023\]

They are not carrying water,  
nor branches nor wood for the fire;  
\[those things\] are supplied by themselves:[^138]  
that’s the fruit of a miracle.[^139] (36) \[4024\]

Taking a tub made of iron,[^140]  
they’re living inside the forest;[^141]  
even elephants, great cobras  
and lions do not frighten \[them\]. (37) \[4025\]

Some would travel to Goyāna,  
others to Pubbavideha,  
and some to Utturukuru,  
depending on[^142] \[just their\] own strength;  
carrying \[their\] alms food from there,  
they are eating \[it\] together. (38, 39a-b) \[4026\]

When all of \[those\] fierce ascetics,[^143]  
\[those\] neutral ones, were taking off,  
the forest is then noisy with  
the flapping[^144] of deer-leather robes. (39c-d, 40a-b) \[4027\]

Of that sort were those great heroes,  
\[those\] fierce ascetics, my students;  
\[always\] surrounded by them, I  
am living in my hermitage. (40c-d, 41a-b) \[4028\]

Satisfied through \[their\] own karma,  
educated,[^145] come together,  
morally-upright \[and\] clever,  
skillful in the \[four\] boundless states,[^146]  
wishing[^147] \[to boost their\] own karma,  
they are propitiating me. (41c-d, 42) \[4029\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
recognizing the proper time,[^148]  
the Guide approached \[my hermitage\]. (43) \[4030\]

Having approached, the Sambuddha,  
the Zealous One,[^149] Clever, the Sage,  
the Sambuddha, taking \[his\] bowl,  
approached me \[begging\] for alms food. (44) \[4031\]

Spreading out a mat made of grass  
\[for\] the Great Hero who’d approached,  
the one whose name was “Best Lotus,”  
I showered \[him\] with *sal* flowers. (45) \[4032\]

Having the Sambuddha sit down,  
my mind \[stirred up\] with emotion,[^150]  
quickly ascending a mountain,  
I brought \[some fragrant\] aloe wood.[^151] (46) \[4033\]

Taking a divinely-scented  
jak fruit[^152] big as a water-jug,[^153]  
hoisting it up on \[my\] shoulder,  
I went up to \[him\], the Leader. (47) \[4034\]

Giving the fruit to the Buddha,  
I anointed \[him\] with aloe.  
Happy, with pleasure in my heart,  
I worshipped \[him\], the Best Buddha. (48) \[4035\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
seated amidst \[those great\] sages,  
\[then\] spoke these verses \[about me\]: (49) \[4036\]

“He who gave me fruit and aloe,  
and \[also a place\] to sit down,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (50) \[4037\]

In a village or a forest,  
atop mountains or inside caves,  
recognizing this man’s wishes,[^154]  
food will come into existence. (51) \[4038\]

\[Whether\] born in the world of gods  
or in that of men, this person  
will satisfy his retinue  
with food and \[also\] with clothing. (52) \[4039\]

In whatever womb \[he’s\] reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
having[^155] inexhaustible[^156] food,  
this person’s going to transmigrate. (53) \[4040\]

For thirty thousand aeons he’ll  
delight in the world of the gods.  
A thousand times he’ll be a king,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (54) \[4041\]

Seventy-one \[different\] times  
he will exercise divine rule,  
\[and he will have\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (55) \[4042\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (56) \[4043\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (57) \[4044\]

The gain for me was well-received,  
which is that I saw the Leader.  
Obtaining the three knowledges,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (58) \[4045\]

In a village or a forest,  
atop mountains or inside caves,  
recognizing what I’m wishing,  
food is always coming to[^157] me. (59) \[4046\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (60) \[4047\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (61) \[4048\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (62) \[4049\]

Thus indeed Venerable Upasīva Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Upasīva Thera is finished.

[^36]: Sinh. *araḷu*, myrobalan, black- or chebulic myrobalan; Terminalia chebula. The list of fruits in this verse closely parallels that in TherAp \#1, v. 33 \[<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> 168\] above, but there the focus is on their flowers, not their fruits.

[^40]: *vibhīṭaka*, Sinh. *buḷu*, Terminalia bellirica (sic bellerica), beleric myrobalan or bastard myrobalan. Together with myroblan proper (*araḷu*) and Indian gooseberry (*nelli*), bahera is one of the three myroblans upon which many Ayurvedic and Sinhala medicines are based; the dried nuts are typically pounded into powder which is then used in oils and other decoctions. Here, on the contrary, the reference is likely to the fresh fruit of these trees, which is also used in medicines and eaten (especially gooseberrry).

[^71]: RD says this is a water-plant, a kind of lotus, referencing J iv.539; vi.47, 279, 564. Here <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> glosses it as *madāra* tree \[mountain-ebony, Bauhinia purpurea (*Legum.*)\] and says the blossoms fell into the water from overhanging trees.

[^84]: *gahakā*, lit., “seizers.” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> glosses this as a third type of crocodile (*gäṭa-kimbulō*), underlining (as does my translation here) the main point that fierce water-beasts are born there.
