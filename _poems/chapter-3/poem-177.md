### \[177. Ekadīpiya[^1]\]

With a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind,  
I gave a single lamp \[back then\]  
at the superb Saḷala[^2] Bodhi  
of the Sage, Padumuttara. (1) \[2133\]

Transmigrating in existence,  
reborn with \[great\] heaps of merit,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of a lamp-gift. (2) \[2134\]

In the sixteen-thousandth aeon  
there were these four \[different\] men \[then\],  
\[all\] known by the name Candābha,[^3]  
wheel-turning kings with great power. (3) \[2135\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2136\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekadīpiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekadīpiya Thera is finished.
