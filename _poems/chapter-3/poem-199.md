*\[199. Kiṅkaṇipupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
The Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
known by the name Sumaṅgala,  
the Victor, entered the city,  
having come out of the forest. (1) \[2260\]  
Having wandered about for alms,  
the Sage \[then\] departed the city.  
The Sambuddha, his duty done,  
\[again\] dwelt inside the forest. (2) \[2261\]  
Taking a *kiṅkaṇi* flower,  
cheerful, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I \[offered \[it\] to the Buddha,  
the Self-Become One, the Great Sage. (3) \[2262\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I offered that flower \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[2263\]  
In the eighty-sixth aeon hence  
was one named Apilāpiya[^2]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (5) \[2264\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2265\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Kiṅkaṇipupphiya[^3] Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kiṅkaṇipupphiya[^4] Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “*Kiṅkaṇi* Flower-er.” This is the BJTS reading. PTS reads
    Tikaṇḍipupphiya*, “*Tikaṇḍi Flower-er”  
[^2]: perhaps “Not Sinking,” reading privative *a* + *pilāpiya* taken
    from \*plu, *plavati, pilavati *  
[^3]: PTS reads Tikaṇḍipupphiya, “*Tikaṇḍi* Flower-er”  
[^4]: PTS reads Tikaṇḍipupphiya, “*Tikaṇḍi* Flower-er”
