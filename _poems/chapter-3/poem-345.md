*\[342. {345.}*[^1] *Nalāgārika*[^2]*\]*  
Close to the Himalayan range,  
there’s a mountain named Hārita.[^3]  
The Self-Become One, Nārada,  
dwelt at the roots of a tree then. (1) \[3104\]

Having fashioned a house of reeds,  
I covered it with grass \[as thatch\],  
\[and\] clearing a walkway I \[then\]  
gave \[them\] to the Self-Become One. (2) \[3105\]

In the fourteenth aeon \[ago\]  
I delighted in the gods’ world,  
and seventy-four times did I  
exercise rule over the gods. (3) \[3106\]

And seventy-seven times I  
was \[then\] a wheel-turning monarch.  
There was \[also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (4) \[3107\]

My dwelling-place was very tall,  
rising up like Indra’s post.  
One thousand-pillared, unsurpassed,  
a mansion full of radiance. (5) \[3108\]

Enjoying both accomplishments,[^4]  
incited by \[my\] wholesome roots,  
I went forth in the religion[^5]  
of Gotama, the Blessed One. (6) \[3109\]

Being one bent on exertion,  
calmed,[^6] devoid of grounds for rebirth,[^7]  
like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (7) \[3110\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[3111\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nalāgārika Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Nalāgārika Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Reed-Hut-er.” BJTS reads *Naḷāgārika.*

[^3]: perhaps “Charming,” from *hāri*, or “Carrying,” from *harati.* A parallel *apdāna* below, of Naḷakuṭika Thera, which begins with the same two verses, reads the name as Bhārika (BJTS Bhārita) with *Hārito* and *Hiriko* as alts.

[^4]: i.e., birth as a human being and birth as a god

[^5]: *sāsane,* lit., “dispensation”

[^6]: *upasanto*

[^7]: *nirūpadhi*
