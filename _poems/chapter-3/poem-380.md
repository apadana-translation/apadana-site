*\[377. {380.}*[^1] *Kāsumāriphaladāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
sitting down on a mountainside,  
shining like a dinner-plate tree.[^3] (1) \[3272\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
hands pressed together on \[my\] head,  
gathering *kāsumāri*[^4] fruit,  
I gave \[it\] to the Best Buddha. (2) \[3273\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave that fruit \[to the Buddha\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[3274\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3275\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[3276\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[3277\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kāsumāriphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Kāsumāriphaladāyaka Thera is finished.  
The Summary:  
Bodhi and Pāṭalipupphi,  
Uppali, Sattapaṇṇiya,  
Gandhamuṭṭhi and Citaka,  
Tāla, Sumanadāmaka,  
and Kāsumāriphala too:  
one fewer than sixty verses.  
The Bodhivandaka Chapter, the Thirty-Eighth  
[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.  
[^2]: “*Kāsumāri-*Fruit Donor.” This *apadāna* also appears as \#500
    {503} below, with the same name and only the slight change that the
    first and second verses of the three-verse concluding refrain are
    inverted.
