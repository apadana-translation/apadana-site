### \[103. Uppalahatthiya[^1]\]

I was living in Tivarā,  
a garland-maker at that time.  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
Siddhattha, Worshipped by the World. (1) \[1623\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I gave a handful of flowers.  
In whichever place I’m reborn,  
in accordance with that karma, (2) \[1624\]

I enjoy the pleasant fruit of  
what I did well, myself, back then.  
I’m encircled by lovely flowers:  
that’s the fruit of giving flowers.[^2] (3) \[1625\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I offered that flower \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (4) \[1626\]

Starting ninety-four \[aeons\] hence,  
\[and\] excepting the present time,  
there were five hundred kings \[who lived;\]  
\[all were\] known as Najjupama.[^3] (5) \[1627\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1628\]

Thus indeed Venerable Uppalahatthiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Uppalahatthiya Thera is finished.
