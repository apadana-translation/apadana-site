### \[133. <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andanapūjaka[^1]\]

On <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andabhāgā River’s bank,  
I was a *kinnara*[^2] back then.  
I lived on flowers as \[my\] food  
and dressed in clothes[^3] made of flowers. (1) \[1886\]

But Atthadassi, Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
departed through the forest’s roof,  
like a swan-king \[flies\] through the air. (2) \[1887\]

“Praise to you, O Well-Bred Person;  
your heart is \[so\] well-purified.  
Your complexion \[shows your\] pleasure;  
your face \[shows your\] senses are clear.” (3) \[1888\]

The Wise One, Great Intelligence,  
having descended from the sky,  
\[and\] spreading out his upper robe  
\[sat\][^4] on it, legs crossed together. (4) \[1889\]

Carrying \[some\] sandalwood oil,  
I went to the Victor's presence.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I gave \[that oil\] to the Buddha. (5) \[1890\]

Having worshipped the Sambuddha,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
experiencing great delight,  
I departed facing the north. (6) \[1891\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I did sandalwood-*pūjā*,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (7) \[1892\]

In the fourteenth aeon ago  
there were three people \[who lived then\],  
\[all\] known by the name Rohiṇi,[^5]  
wheel-turning kings with great power. (8) \[1893\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1894\]

Thus indeed Venerable <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andanapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andanapūjaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Sandalwood-Worshipper”

[^2]: reading BJTS for the correct spelling for *kiṇṇara* (PTS). The *kinnara* (Sinh. *kandura*) has a human head and a horse’s body; “centaur”.

[^3]: v*asano* could also be translated, “lived in a dwelling” \[made of flowers\].

[^4]: lit., “entered”

[^5]: “Red Cow.” BJTS reads Rohita, “Red”.
