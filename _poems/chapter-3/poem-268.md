*\[268. Saḷalapupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
On Candabhāgā River’s bank  
I was a *kinnara*[^2] back then.  
I saw the Buddha, Vipassi,  
Surrounded by[^3] a Net of Rays. (1) \[2569\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
and \[filled\] with supreme joyfulness,  
taking a *saḷala* flower,  
I strew \[it before\] Vipassi. (2) \[2570\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2571\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2572\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saḷalapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Saḷalapupphiya Thera is finished.
