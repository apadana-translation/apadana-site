*\[104. Padapūjaka*[^1]*\]*  
I gave a jasmine flower to  
Siddhattha, \[then\] the Blessed One,  
\[and\] with laughter I \[then\] scattered[^2]  
seven flowers upon his feet. (1) \[1629\]  
Due to that karma, today I  
have surpassed gods as well as men.  
I am bearing my last body  
in the Buddha’s[^3] dispensation. (2) \[1630\]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I offered that flower \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of flower-*pūjā.* (3) \[1631\]  
There were thirteen wheel-turning kings;  
\[all were\] named Samantagandha,[^4]  
lords over groups on all four sides,  
\[then\] in the fifth aeon ago. (4) \[1632\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1633\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Padapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Padapūjaka Thera is finished.
