*\[237. Piyālapupphiya*[^1]*\]*  
I was a deer-hunter back then,  
within a grove in the forest.  
Having seen a *piyal*[^2] flower  
I tossed it on the traveled road.[^3] (1) \[2450\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (2) \[2451\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2452\]

Thus indeed Venerable Piyālapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Piyālapupphiya Thera is finished.  
[^1]: *“Piyal* flower-er”  
[^2]: *piyāla* (Sinh. *piyal*) is buchanania latifolia.  
[^3]: this could mean the road traveled by the hunter, but given the
    indication that this was a very meritorious act, more likely the
    implication is, “tossed it on the road which the Buddha \[who
    thirty-one aeons ago likely would have been Sikhi Buddha or perhaps
    a Lonely Buddha\] had traveled along”.
