*\[107. Naḷamāliya*[^1]*\]*  
Taking up a garland of reeds  
and binding it I \[then\] approached  
Padumuttara, the Buddha,  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One,  
the Tranquil One, the Neutral One,  
who was seated in the grass \[then,\]  
\[and there\] I fanned the Biped-Lord,  
the Buddha, \[he\], the Neutral One.[^2] (1-2) \[1646-1647\]  
The Omniscient One received \[it,\]  
\[then\] the World-Leader fanned \[himself\].  
Discerning what I was thinking,  
he spoke this verse \[about me then\]: (3) \[1648\]  
“Just as \[this one\] cooled my body  
he will not feel the scorch \[of hell\];  
just so your heart will be freed from  
the three-fold fire \[of existence\].” (4) \[1649\]  
All the gods gathered in a tree  
whichever ones \[were then thinking\],  
“we’ll hear the words of the Buddha  
which will cause the donor to laugh.” (5) \[1650\]  
\[Then\], seated there, the Blessed One,  
Honored by the Gods’ Assembly  
bringing laughter to the donor  
spoke these verses \[about me too\]: (6) \[1651\]  
“Because of this gift of fanning  
and the resolve in \[his own\] heart,  
he’ll become a wheel-turning king  
known by the name of Subbata.[^3] (7) \[1652\]  
Through the remainder of that deed,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
he’ll become a wheel-turning king  
known by the name of Māluta.[^4] (8) \[1653\]  
Because of this gift of fanning  
and \[his\] abundant honoring,  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
he’ll come to know no bad rebirth.” (9) \[1654\]  
In the thirty-thousandth aeon  
there were eight \[kings named\] Subbata.  
In the twenty-nine thousandth \[aeon\]  
there were eight \[kings\] named Māluta. (10) \[1655\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[1656\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Naḷamāliya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Naḷamāliya Thera is finished.

[^2]: It is unclear whether the repetition of “Neutral One” (*tādino*)
    in this string of epithets is intentional (as to emphasize that
    particular quality) or not (perhaps through conflation of other
    now-lost epithets)  
[^3]: “Good Vow” or “Compliant One” (as below, as a Buddha epithet)  
[^4]: “Breeze”
