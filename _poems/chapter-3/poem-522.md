### \[519. {522.}[^1] Pe<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chadāyaka[^2]\]

I gifted one \[thing called\] *pe<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha*,[^3]  
with \[great\] pleasure, with \[both my\] hands,  
to Vipassi, the Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One. (1) \[5550\]

Elephant \[and\] horse vehicles,  
divine vehicles are obtained;  
due to that gift of a *pe<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha*,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (2) \[5551\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that *pe<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha* back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of giving a *pe<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha*. (3) \[5552\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (10) \[5553\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[5554\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[5555\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pe<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chadāyaka[^4] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pe<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chadāyaka[^5] Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Bed Donor.” This is the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reading; <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reads *Pe<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chadāyaka°* and also *ekape<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>chaŋ* in v. 1.

[^3]: the transmission of this *apadāna* is quite inconsistent with regard to the type of gift, and by extension the name of the arahant. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads “a single bed” (*mañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>a*). <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *Pe<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha* is of uncertain meaning. The cty provides no comment, and the references to the gift in subsequent verses, and the name in the colophons, vary from manuscript to manuscript depending upon the term supplied in this verse by the various editors, so there is really no way to suss out a “correct” reading. The same *apadāna* is repeated verbatim (except for the elision of the first two verses of the standard three-verse concluding refrain) above as \#355 {358}, where <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reads *Sajjhadāyaka* (“Piece of Silver Donor”) and “one piece of silver” (*ekaŋ saŋjjhaŋ*) in v 1; <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> again gives *Mañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>adāyaka* there. I follow <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> in both instances because it is the default text employed in this translation, but any of these is possible (is <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> more likely for its consistency and intelligibility?), and something different still is perhaps preferable, given that the intermediate fruit is stated to be receipt of various sorts of vehicles.

[^4]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *Mañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>adāyaka*

[^5]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *Mañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>adāyaka*
