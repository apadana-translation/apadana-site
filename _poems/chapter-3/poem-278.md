*\[278. Āluvadāyaka*[^1]*\]*

On a Himalayan mountain

flows the great Indus, beautiful.

There I saw the Passionless One,

the Radiant One,[^2] Beautiful. (1) \[2612\]

Amazed after \[I\] had seen him,

Engaged in the Ultimate Calm,

I gave \[some\] bulbous roots to him,

\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[my\] own hands. (2) \[2613\]

In the thirty-one aeons since

I gave those bulbous roots back then,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of bulbous-root-gifts. (3) \[2614\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered:

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2615\]

Thus indeed Venerable Āluvadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Āluvadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Bulbous Root Donor.” BJTS glosses this term as Sinh. *ala,* root,
    bulbous root, as in *ala-tarpal,* potato. Cty says it was a portion
    (*khaṇḍa*) of the stuff.

[^2]: following cty and BJTS in reading *sappapabhāsa* as =
    *su-(p)pabhāsa,* “very bright”
