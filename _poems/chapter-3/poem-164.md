### \[164. Desapūjaka[^1]\]

Atthadassi, the Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
having risen into the sky  
was going through the air \[back then\]. (1) \[2067\]

I did *pūjā* to the place where  
the Teacher had been standing when  
he, the Sage so Great, rose upward,  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[my\] own hands. (2) \[2068\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I saw the Great Sage \[back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of region-*pūjā*. (3) \[2069\]

In the eleven-hundredth aeon  
I was known as Gosujāta,[^2]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2070\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2071\]

Thus indeed Venerable Desapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Desapūjaka Thera is finished.
