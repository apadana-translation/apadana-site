*\[202. Vinelapupphiya*[^1]*\]*

The Golden-Colored Blessed One,

Hundred-Rayed, the Majestic One,[^2]

Loving-Hearted, Brilliant as Fire[^3]

had ascended the walkway \[there\]. (1) \[2275\]

Cheerful, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,

worshipping the supreme knowledge,

taking a *vinela*[^4] blossom,

I offered \[it\] to the Buddha. (2) \[2276\]

In the thirty-one aeons since

I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,

I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:

that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (3) \[2277\]

In the twenty-ninth aeon \[hence\]

\[I was\] named Sumeghaghana,[^5]

a wheel-turning king with great strength,

possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2278\]

The four analytical modes,

and these eight deliverances,

six special knowledges mastered,

\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2279\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vinelapupphiya[^6] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Vinelapupphiya[^7] Thera is finished.
