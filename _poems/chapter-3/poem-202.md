### \[202. Vinelapupphiya[^1]\]

The Golden-Colored Blessed One,  
Hundred-Rayed, the Majestic One,[^2]  
Loving-Hearted, Brilliant as Fire[^3]  
had ascended the walkway \[there\]. (1) \[2275\]

Cheerful, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
worshipping the supreme knowledge,  
taking a *vinela*[^4] blossom,  
I offered \[it\] to the Buddha. (2) \[2276\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2277\]

In the twenty-ninth aeon \[hence\]  
\[I was\] named Sumeghaghana,[^5]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2278\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2279\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vinelapupphiya[^6] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Vinelapupphiya[^7] Thera is finished.
