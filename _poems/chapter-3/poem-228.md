*\[228. Miñjavaṭaŋsakiya*[^1]*\]*  
When the World’s Lord reached nirvana,  
Sikhi, Best among Debaters,  
I did *pūjā* to \[his\] Bodhi[^2]  
\[by\] covering \[it\] with hair-wreaths. (1) \[2411\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that *pūjā* at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Bodhi-*pūjā.* (2) \[2412\]

In the twenty-sixth aeon hence  
there was one known as Meghabbha,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[2413\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2414\]

Thus indeed Venerable Miñjavaṭaŋsakiya Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Miñjavaṭaŋsakiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “\[Donor\] of a Wreath of Kernels.” *miñja* = the kernel or pit of
    a fruit

[^2]: i.e., his Bodhi Tree. According to BV, the Bodhi Tree of Sikhi
    Buddha was *pundarika, Mangifera indica*, the Mango.

[^3]: “Cloud-Light”
