*\[97. Madhupiṇḍika*[^1]*\]*  
In a quiet and trouble-free  
forest grove, I \[once\] having seen  
Siddhattha the Sage, the Supreme,[^2]  
Sacrificial Recipient, (1) \[1588\]  
Gone-Out-One, the Great Elephant,  
Bull of Men,[^3] like a thoroughbred,  
shining forth like the morning star,[^4]  
praised by the assembly of gods,  
much[^5] happiness arose in me;  
knowledge came into being then. (2) \[1589\][^6]  
Giving honey to the Teacher  
who’d risen from meditation,  
\[and\] worshipping the Teacher’s feet,  
I departed facing the east. (3) \[1590\]  
\[Then\] thirty-four aeons \[ago\]  
I was the king, Sudassana;[^7]  
sweet honey flowed from lotus roots  
whenever I was eating \[them\].  
\[And\] it rained a rain of honey:  
that’s the fruit of former karma. (4) \[1591\][^8]  
In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that honey back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving honey. (5) \[1592\]  
\[And\] thirty-four aeons ago  
there were four \[named\] Sudassana,  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (6) \[1593\]  
The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1594\]  
Thus indeed Venerable Madhupiṇḍika Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Madhupiṇḍika Thera is finished.  
[^1]: “Honey-Ball-er”  
[^2]: reading *seṭṭhaṃ* (BJTS) for *setthaŋ* (PTS)  
[^3]: compare *nisabha* with *narasabha*, which I also translate “Bull
    of Men”.  
[^4]: *osadhī*. RD (s.v.) points out that all we really know about this
    star is that it was particularly bright, leading Childers to
    translate it as “Venus” and others as the morning star.  
[^5]: reading *pahutā āsi* (BJTS) for *pahunā tāva* (PTS)  
[^6]: BJTS agrees with PTS in presenting this as a six-footed verse  
[^7]: “Good to Look At”  
[^8]: PTS does not include the last two feet of this verse, which appear
    only in BJTS. The latter presents it as a six-footed verse, the
    former as a four-footed verse containing the first four feet
    translated here.
