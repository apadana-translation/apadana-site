*\[82. Gatasaññaka\]*  
I went forth into homelessness  
being \[only\] seven years \[old\].  
With a mind that was very clear  
I \[then\] worshipped the Teacher’s feet. (1) \[1506\]

\[Then\] I tossed up into the air  
seven *nagaliki* flowers  
for the sake of Tissa Buddha,  
the Boundless Ocean of Virtues. (2) \[1507\]

Happy-minded, I did *pūjā*  
on the road the Well-Gone-One trod,  
then I pressed my hands together  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[my\] own hands. (3) \[1508\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā.* (4) \[1509\]

In the eighth aeon after that  
there were three \[named\] Aggisikha.[^1]  
\[They were\] wheel-turners with great strength,  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[1510\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1511\]

Thus indeed Venerable Gatasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Gatasaññaka Thera is finished.
