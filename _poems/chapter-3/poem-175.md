### \[175. Sīhāsanadāyaka[^1]\]

When the World’s Lord reached nirvana,  
Padumuttara, the Leader,  
I gave a lion-throne \[to him\]  
with a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind. (1) \[2124\]

Bringing happiness to the world,  
with very fragrant flowers \[then\]  
having done a *pūjā* there, \[I\]  
did bring relief to many folks.[^2] (2) \[2125\]

With a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind  
worshipping that superb Bodhi,  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth. (3) \[2126\]

In the fifteen-thousandth aeon  
there were eight \[different people\],  
monarchs who turned the wheel \[of law\],  
\[all\] known by the name Sīluccaya.[^3] (4) \[2127\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2128\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sīhāsanadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sīhāsanadāyaka Thera is finished.
