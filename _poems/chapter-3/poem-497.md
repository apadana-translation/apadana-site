*\[494. {497.}*[^1] *Udakadāyaka*[^2]*\]*  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I filled the drinking-water jug  
for the superb monks’ Assembly  
of Padumuttara Buddha. (1) \[5298\]

On a mountain top or bad road[^3]  
or in \[any\] space on the earth,  
if I wish for drinking water,  
quickly it is produced for me. (2) \[5299\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave that donation then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving water. (3) \[5300\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (4) \[5301\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[5302\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[5303\]

Thus indeed Venerable Udakadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.  
The legend of Udakadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the
    BJTS edition, which contains more individual poems than does the PTS
    edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Water Donor.” See \#206, above, for a (different) *apadāna*
    ascribed to a monk with this same name.

[^3]: *dumagge,* could also be “top of a tree” (as in many *apadānas*
    about rag-robe), but here “bad road" seems more likely to me.
