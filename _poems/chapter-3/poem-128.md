### \[128. Ñāṇasaññaka[^1]\]

I resided on a mountain  
in the Himalayan Mountains.  
Having seen some pure \[white\] sand I  
recollected the Best Buddha: (1) \[1849\]

“Knowledge has no analogy;  
neither does meeting the Teacher.[^2]  
After learning all the Teaching  
one is set free by \[that\] knowledge. (2) \[1850\]

Praise to you, O Well-Bred Person![^3]  
Praise to you, Ultimate Person!  
There’s no one who’s the same as you  
in terms of knowledge, Best of Men.” (3) \[1851\]

Having pleased \[my\] heart in knowledge,  
I thrilled an aeon in heaven.  
During the aeons that remained,  
I completed that good karma.[^4](4) \[1852\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I obtained that perception \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of knowledge-perception. (5) \[1853\]

In the seventy-third aeon  
one \[named\] Puḷinapupphiya[^5]  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (6) \[1854\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1855\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ñāṇasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ñāṇasaññaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Knowledge-Perceiver”

[^2]: lit., “neither \[is there an analogy\] for association of \[with\] the Teacher.” My translation of this verse follows the BJTS Sinhala gloss.
