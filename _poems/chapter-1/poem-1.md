### Buddha Chapter, the First {.ch-heading}
# The Legend of the Buddhas

Praise Him, the Blessed One, the Worthy One, the Fully Complete Buddha!

The Sage of Vedeha,[^1] his body bent, asked  
the Thus-Gone-One dwelling in Jetavana,  
“Indeed there are those \[called\] Omniscient Buddhas;  
through what causes do they become \[so\], Hero?”[^2] \[1\][^3]

Then spoke the Omniscient, Outstanding, Great Sage,  
to lucky Ānanda with \[his\] honeyed voice,  
“Who performed service among former Buddhas,  
\[but\] didn’t get freed in those Victors’ teachings,[^4] \[2\]

because that’s the means to awaken, the Wise,  
because of \[their\] wishes \[and\] also great strength,  
through knowledge and power, those with sharp knowing  
do come to attain that state of omniscience. \[3\]

I too among former Buddhas    
did wish to become a Buddha.[^5]  
Through \[my\] mind alone there were  
innumerable *Dhamma*-kings. \[4\]

\[Now\] listen, with purified minds  
to the legends of the Buddhas,  
innumerable *Dhamma*-kings  
who fulfilled thirty perfections. (1) \[5\]

I worshipped them \[bowing\] my head  
with ten fingers pressed having praised  
those World-Chiefs with \[their\] followers  
\[and\] the Best Buddhas’ Awakening. (2) \[6\]

I brought it all forth with my mind:  
things on the ground and in the sky  
uncountable as are the gems  
found in the fields of the Buddhas. (3) \[7\]

I created a palace there,  
with a floor made out of silver.  
Various floors made out of gems  
arose and stretched up toward the sky. (4) \[8\]

There were varied well-made pillars,  
well-proportioned, very costly.  
The central beam was made of gold,  
the gateway canopy-adorned. (5) \[9\]

The first floor, lapis lazuli,  
was lovely as a stainless cloud.  
Lotus ponds were scattered about  
on a floor made of superb gold. (6) \[10\]

A coral \[floor\], coral-colored,  
was red and \[very\] beautiful;  
\[that\] floor lit up the directions  
with light the hue of red beetles.[^6] (7) \[11\]

Doors and windows and turrets \[too\],  
and four railings were well-laid-out.  
It had a scented bamboo net  
which was delightful to the mind. (8) \[12\]

There were excellent gabled roofs  
\[colored\] blue \[and\] yellow \[and\] red,  
white \[and also\] mixed black-and-white,  
adorned with the seven gemstones. (9) \[13\]

Lovely \[pictures of\] birds and beasts  
and lotuses fashioned for looks;  
it was adorned with moon and sun,  
dotted with star-constellations. (10) \[14\]

It was covered with a gold net  
furnished with little golden bells.  
Those gold garlands sang in the force  
of the wind, delighting the mind. (11) \[15\]

A garland of flags was hoisted,  
dyed[^7] in a spectrum[^8] of colors:  
some light crimson, others deep red,  
tawny, yellow and yellowish. (12) \[16\]

Numerous various hundreds  
of slabs were made out of silver,  
made of crystal, made of ruby,  
\[and\] likewise made out of cat’s eye. (13) \[17\]

Various diverse couches were  
spread with soft Benares muslin,  
rugs, fine silk, and cloth from China,  
fibrous cloth and yellow garments.  
All of these various carpets  
I laid out \[on them\] with my mind. (14) \[17e-f, 18\]

On this floor and that \[floor\] too  
ornamented with huts of gems  
effulgent torches \[made of\] gems  
are being carried and fixed well. (15) \[19\]

Columns \[and\] pillars are splendid,  
and beautiful golden gateways  
made of special gold[^9] and hard woods,  
and also made out of silver. (16) \[20\]

Varied windows, well-proportioned;[^10]  
painted cross-bars \[adorned\] the doors,  
with “pots of plenty” on both sides,  
filled with lotuses and lilies. (17) \[21\]

I conjured up all past Buddhas,  
World-Leaders, \[their\] Assemblies too,  
with their natural complexions  
\[and\] forms, and \[all\] their followers. (18) \[22\]

Having entered through the doorway  
all the Buddhas and followers  
sat down on chairs all made of gold  
\[and formed\] an exalted circle.[^11] (19) \[23\]

Those Buddhas who live here-and-now,  
who have no rivals in the world,  
and those who lived in former times:  
I brought[^12] them all into the world.[^13] (20) \[24\]

Lonely Buddhas, many hundreds,  
self-dependent, unconquered ones,  
and those who lived in former times:  
I brought them all into the world. (21) \[25\]

There are many wishing-trees there  
who are both human and divine.  
Having arranged all of the cloth  
I give them \[each\] the triple robe. (22) \[26\]

Filling lovely bowls made of gems  
I then provided \[alms\] to them:  
foods that were soft, \[and\] hard foods \[too\],  
well-prepared food and drink to taste. (23) \[27\]

Being given burnished-cloth robes  
which were \[just like\] divine garments,  
honey and crystallized sugar,  
sesame oil \[and\] sugar-cane juice,  
with milk-rice,[^14] each one satisfied,  
\[they formed\] an exalted circle. (24) \[28, 29a-b\]

Having entered a jeweled room  
like a lion its secret cave  
they got onto priceless couches  
in the sleeping-lion posture. (25) \[29c-d, 30a-b\]

Mindfully rising up they \[then\]  
sat cross-legged on those couches,  
filled with delight in altered states  
the pasturage of all Buddhas. (26) \[30c-f\]

Some are preaching their doctrines \[then\],  
\[while\] others sport in miracles.  
Others apply special knowledges,[^15]  
masters of special knowledges.  
Various lakhs of others still  
transform into various shapes.[^16] (27) \[31\]

Buddhas are questioning Buddhas  
about the range of omniscience.[^17]  
Understanding deep, abstruse points,  
they achieve their Awakenings. (28) \[32\]

Followers questioning Buddhas;  
Buddhas questioning followers.  
Questioning one another they  
\[then\] provide each other answers. (29) \[33\]

Buddhas and Lonely Buddhas \[too\]  
followers and the attendants  
thus delighting in devotions  
are really enjoying the palace. (30) \[34\]

Let there be carried over head  
a pearl-net-draped umbrella,  
combined with \[more\] nets made of gold  
and also of silver and gems. (31) \[35\][^18]

Let there be awnings made of cloth  
decorated with golden stars  
and with diverse garlands spread out,  
let all be carried over head. (32) \[36\]

They are spread out with flowered wreaths,  
\[and\] beautified with scented wreaths;  
studded with wreaths made out of cloth  
decorated with wreaths of gems. (33) \[37\]

They are strewn with varied flowers,  
\[and\] scented with fragrant perfumes,  
marked with special scented palm-prints,[^19]  
\[and\] covered with golden covers. (34) \[38\]

Let lotus-ponds in four directions  
full of lotuses and lilies  
appear like they were formed of gold  
exuding dusty lotus-pollen. (35) \[39\]

Let all the trees that are around  
the palace burst forth into bloom.  
And in the evening let those flowers  
release sweet scents, sprinkling the realm. (36) \[40\]

Let peacocks there begin to dance  
to the songs of heavenly swans  
and let cuckoos make melodies:  
on all sides \[there’s\] a choir of birds. (37) \[41\]

Let all the drums \[now\] be sounded;  
let all the stringed instruments[^20] wail.  
Let all the choruses commence  
on every side of the palace. (38) \[42\]

Let there be couches made of gold --  
very large, endowed with brightness,  
without blemish, fashioned with gems --  
throughout the field of the Buddhas,  
and in the universe beyond.[^21]  
Let the stands of lamps be lighted;  
let a series of ten thousand  
all burn as though one single flame. (39-40) \[43-44\]

Let courtesans and dancers dance,  
\[and\] troupes of celestial nymphs.  
Let them put on various shows  
on all the sides of the palace. (41) \[45\]

On tree top or mountain top  
or the crest of Mount Sineru  
I am raising up all the flags  
decorated \[and\] five-colored. (42) \[46\]

Let people, snake-gods, music-nymphs[^22]  
and all the gods come forth \[as well\];  
in homage, hands pressed together  
they attended on the palace. (43) \[47\]

Whatever is wholesome karma,  
which deeds were to be done by me,  
with body, speech and with my mind  
\[I\] did them well \[to reach\] heaven.[^23] (44) \[48\]

Whichever beings have consciousness  
and also those who aren’t conscious,  
let every one of them receive  
the fruit of merit done by me. (45) \[49\]

That which I did was widely known;  
I gave away that good deed’s fruit  
and gods went off to make it known  
to \[all\] those who were unaware. (46) \[50\]

Let all the beings in all worlds  
whose lives depend on eating food  
receive by means of my own mind[^24]  
all appetizing things to eat! (47) \[51\]

With my mind these alms were given,  
with my mind the palace was built  
and likewise so were worshipped all  
the Buddhas, Lonelies and disciples. (48) \[52\]

Due to that karma so well done[^25]  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (49) \[53\]

I witness two kinds of rebirth,  
as a human and as a god.  
I do not witness other states:  
that’s the fruit of mental wishes. (50) \[54\]

Among the gods I am the chief;  
I am the ruler among men.  
Endowed with beauty and \[good\] marks  
in knowledge unrivaled \[each\] birth. (51) \[55\]

Savory foods of different types  
and fabulous precious gemstones,  
likewise clothes of various sorts  
quickly come to me from the sky. (52) \[56\]

On flat earth, so on a mountain,  
in the air, in water or woods,  
whenever I stretch out my hand  
divine foods are coming to me. (53) \[57\]

On flat earth, so on a mountain,  
in the air, in water or woods,  
whenever I stretch out my hand  
all gemstones are coming to me. (54) \[58\]

On flat earth, so on a mountain,  
in the air, in water or woods,  
whenever I stretch out my hand  
all perfumes are coming to me. (55) \[59\]

On flat earth, so on a mountain,  
in the air, in water or woods,  
whenever I stretch out my hand  
all vehicles \[then\] come to me. (56) \[60\]

On flat earth, so on a mountain,  
in the air, in water or woods,  
whenever I stretch out my hand  
all garlands are coming to me. (57) \[61\]

On flat earth, so on a mountain,  
in the air, in water or woods,  
whenever I stretch out my hand  
all ornaments \[then\] come to me. (58) \[62\]

On flat earth, so on a mountain,  
in the air, in water or woods,  
whenever I stretch out my hand  
all maidens are coming to me. (59) \[63\]

On flat earth, so on a mountain,  
in the air, in water or woods,  
whenever I stretch out my hand  
granulated sugar comes to me. (60) \[64\]

On flat earth, so on a mountain,  
in the air, in water or woods,  
whenever I stretch out my hand  
all solid foodstuffs come to me. (61) \[65\]

To attain supreme Awakening  
I gave \[many\] excellent gifts  
to the poor and to the gypsies,  
to beggars and to travelers. (62) \[66\]

Making the rocky mountains shout  
and \[likewise\] making dense hills roar,  
making the world with \[its\] gods smile  
I become Buddha in the world. (63) \[67\]

There’s no end to going about  
in the world in ten directions.  
And in this quarter of the world  
the Buddha-fields can’t be counted. (64) \[68\]

My two-fold raying miracle  
is splendid and \[very\] well-known.  
Therein a net of flames \[appears\]  
and vast effulgence is produced. (65) \[69\]

In so many universes  
let all the people see me \[there\].  
Let them all be made \[most\] happy  
and follow me as their model. (66) \[70\][^26]

Beat the drum of deathlessness  
with its sweet \[and\] distinguished sound.  
Let all the people in that space  
listen \[well\] to the honeyed song. (67) \[71\]

May all of them be undefiled  
on whom the cloud of *Dhamma* rains;  
let even lowly beings there  
become those who enter the stream. (68) \[72\]

I gave the gifts that should be given,  
fully fulfilling the precepts.  
Going into perfect disgust,  
supreme Awakening’s attained. (69) \[73\]

Having inquired of the learned  
having made extreme exertion  
going into perfect patience  
supreme Awakening’s attained. (70) \[74\]

Strengthening my resolution  
I fulfilled the truth-perfection.  
Going into perfect loving  
supreme Awakening’s attained. (71) \[75\]

In getting and in not getting  
in pain or pleasure, scorn or fame,  
remaining everywhere the same  
supreme Awakening’s attained. (72) \[76\]

Looking at laziness with fear  
and with love upon exertion,  
be those exerting selves with faith;  
that’s the advice of the Buddhas. (73) \[77\]

Looking at quarrels full of fear  
and with love upon agreement,  
join together in harmony;  
that’s the advice of the Buddhas. (74) \[78\]

Looking at carelessness with fear  
and with love upon attention,  
\[now\] cultivate the Eight-fold Path;  
that’s the advice of the Buddhas. (75) \[79\]

Many Buddhas come together  
and also all the Arahants.  
Pay homage while you’re worshipping  
the Buddhas and the Arahants. (76) \[80\]

Thus the Buddhas can’t be fathomed;  
unfathomable their Teaching.  
Unfathomable’s the result  
of pleasure in what can’t be fathomed. (77) \[81\]

Thus the Blessed One spoke the short discourse on dharma called “The
Legend of the Buddhas” which was productive of his own Buddha-conduct.

The Legend of the Buddhas is completed.

[^1]: The Sage of Videha is Ānanda, the Buddha’s cousin and personal attendant.
[^2]: BJTS alt. reads *dhīra* (“Wise One”) for *vīra* (“Hero”)
[^3]: The first four verses of BJTS are not found in PTS. The first three verses of BJTS are in the more elaborate meter, with eleven syllables per foot, that characterizes the following *Paccekabuddhāpadāna* (and the *sutta* from which it in turn draws), so I have translated accordingly. Indeed, with very small changes, these first three verses are also the first three verses of *Paccekabuddhāpadāna*, even in the PTS edition.
[^4]: or “dispensation:” *°sāsanesu*
[^5]: Lit., “did wish for Buddhahood.”
[^6]: *indagopaka*
[^7]: I take *sampītaŋ* (BJTS *suppītaṃ*) from *pīta,* “well-saturated.”
[^8]: lit., “various”
[^9]: jambonadā, a special and much-prized variety of gold
[^10]: reading *sandhī suvibhattā* (BJTS, Hew) for *sandhīsu vibhattā* (“divided into openings,”PTS)
[^11]: or “noble diagram,” *ariyamaṇḍalā.*
[^12]: lit., “were brought”.
[^13]: or “into \[my\] residence” or “into \[that conjured up\] residence.”
[^14]: lit., “with the ultimate food,” *parama-anna*. The Sinhala tradition understands this to be milk-rice *(kiri-bat*), which in Sri Lanka is typically made by boiling the rice in coconut milk rather than cow’s milk. In ancient India, the latter was more likely the case. The term may also mean, more literally, “outstanding food.”
[^15]: list these here, first usage
[^16]: lit., transforming themselves into magical transformations
[^17]: lit., “about the range of the realm of omniscience.”
[^18]: here the reading of the Hewawitarne and BJTS editions, echoed in the commentary, is significantly different: “Let there be umbrellas of gems/with gilded handles of scented bamboo//covered in a net of pearls./Let them all be carried out front.”
[^19]: the palm-print is *pañcaṅguli* or *pañcaṅgulika,* SInhala *pasaṅgul.* Pali-SInhala-English Dictionary gives: “a mark of five fingers made after the hand immersing \[sic\] in a solution of sandalwood.” Here the text specifies that it was scented (*gandha°*).
[^20]: *vina.*
[^21]: reading *tato pare* with BJTS for PTS *ca-m-uppari*
[^22]: *gandhabba = gandharva*
[^23]: lit., “for \[birth among\] the Thirty\[-Three gods who reside in Tāvatiṃsa heaven\]”. The BJTS Sinhala gloss understands this to imply that the *karma* was *kusala* (“wholesome”) in that it was done for the sake of being reborn in that heaven/among those gods.
[^24]: BJTS reads *tejasā,* “by means of my power/inner heat”.
[^25]: *tena kammena sukatena*, a common foot in *Apadāna* which however breaks meter in the Pāli, having nine rather than the expected eight syllables. It could be emended to *tena sukatakammena* in order to keep meter in the verses where it appears, but the Pāli does not witness that. Cf. \[5706\], below, for a variant *tena kammavisesana,* which does keep the meter.
[^26]: Hewawitarne reads, perhaps preferably: “all the way to Brahma’s home let them follow my example.” BJTS also records mss. that provide this reading, and gives it parenthetically as an additional line.
