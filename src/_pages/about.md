## The Translation
This is the first-ever complete translation of *Apadāna* into a
Western language. It has been a daunting undertaking, traversing the
translator’s entire professional career, yet it admittedly remains an
imperfect work in progress. Motivated by a sense that scholars,
students, Buddhists and even the general public might enjoy and benefit
from access to this beautiful collection of ancient poetry, he has
pushed ahead, in fits and starts, to produce the present translation,
and to offer it for free to the world in this innovative online format.{.lead}

At times, the problems seemed insurmountable. Because the Pali Text Society
edition, produced by an obscure Miss Mary E. Lilley during the 1920s, is
notoriously corrupt among the generally-reliable products of that august
organization (which probably accounts for the fact that it is the sole narrative
text of the Pāli Canon hitherto untranslated), the translator was led to better
editions in Sinhala, Burmese, Thai and Devanagari scripts. But these turned out
to vary among themselves significantly enough that no single one of them could
be relied upon consistently. While the translator has not produced a new,
critical edition of his own, he has attempted to redress this problem by using
multiple editions, side-by-side. In particular, this is a translation of *both*
the <dfn id="PTS">Pali Text Society</dfn> (<abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>) Roman-script
edition,[^1] which is most widely available in the West, *and* of the <dfn id="BJTS">Buddha
Jayanthi Tripitaka Series</dfn> (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka
Series">BJTS</abbr>) Sinhala-script edition,[^2] which is most widely available
in Sri Lanka. In practice, the translation follows the <a href="#PTS" class="abbr">PTS</a> edition wherever possible, but does not shy away from
translating the <a href="#BJTS" class="abbr">BJTS</a>
edition instead, in places where it corrects mistakes in the <a href="#PTS" class="abbr">PTS</a> edition, includes material not found in the <a href="#PTS" class="abbr">PTS</a> edition, or offers significantly more
plausible readings of obscure passages. The <a href="#BJTS" class="abbr">BJTS</a> edition includes an invaluable Sinhala gloss on
each verse, which has often been followed in translating such obscure passages.
Each of these cases is marked with a sidenote detailing the decision to follow
<a href="#BJTS" class="abbr">BJTS</a> rather than <a href="#PTS" class="abbr">PTS</a>, 
which provides the alternate <a href="#PTS" class="abbr">PTS</a> reading for interested readers.

#### What is the *Apadāna*?{.callout__header}

*Legends of the Buddhist Saints* (*Apadāna*) is a collection of about
six hundred autobiographical poems ascribed to the accomplished Buddhas
and Arahants of the early Buddhist community. Composed in India in the
Pāli language around the second century, <span class="abbr">B.C.E.</span>, *Apadāna* is
the source of many of the best-loved stories of the saints in the
Buddhist world.

Translating both editions at once thus necessitated extensive sidenotes
to mark significant differences between the two editions, as well as the
cumbersome inclusion of the poem and verse numbers which correspond to
each edition (but not always to each other). Similar scholarly
conventions — such as the consistent transliteration of Pāli terms and
names with standard diacritical markings, the use of square brackets to
indicate interpolations made by the translator, and additional,
explanatory sidenotes — will hopefully likewise be of use to scholars,
especially those who use the translation (as they should) merely as a
“pony” for reading the original Pāli. But this scholarly apparatus
nevertheless further encumbers the presentation of the translation to
those who, conversely, wish to read it, or (as they should) recite it,
for the pleasure of the text itself. With the able assistance of
[Dana Johnson][1], the translator has attempted to redress this
problem by making these various aspects of the scholarly apparatus
toggle-able. Those who want to track individual poems or verses in the
original Pāli, or who want to consider variant readings, or who want to
distinguish what is original to the text from what has been added by the
translator for clarity and meter, or who care to see the original Pāli
of technical terms or unusual grammatical formulations, will be able to
do so, by toggling on those various dimensions of the scholarly
apparatus. But those who want to just read the poems as poems can do so
as well, by toggling all that off.

A third problem faced by the translator grew out of his sense that the
form as well as the content of the original must needs be communicated
in the translation. These legends were composed as poems, meant for
recitation, and in numerous cases it is clear that the original authors
were willing to sacrifice grammar, or to throw in filler words, *metri
causa*. To translate the content in prose, even if it included the
various stylistic ornaments of the original, would fail to convey the
fluid, rhythmic beauty which helped make this text so compelling in its
day. But the ultimate decision to translate into English verse was a
hard one, both because English lacks the flexibility that allowed the
Pāli authors to exercise their literary muscles, and because translation
(even of poetry) into prose has become something of a convention in
Buddhist Studies (which thereby inevitably sacrifices form for content).
There are certainly some fine models for translation of Buddhist poetry
into verse, such as the early translations of *Theragāthā* and
*Therīgāthā* into English verse by Mrs. C. A. F. Rhys Davids, and the
more recent ones by Prof. Charles Hallisey, but these translators have
adopted the poetic conventions of their own day, rather than those of
the text itself. For readers of Tennyson or Ginsberg the Lockesley-Hall
meter of Mrs. Rhys Davids, or the free verse of Prof. Hallisey,
respectively, really “work” as poetry…but those texts, like *Apadāna*
(to which they are in fact closely related), are composed in neither
ornate Victorian nor crisp modernist idioms; they are composed in
*gāthās* containing four, eight-syllable lines each. The present
translator thus decided neither to translate into prose, nor to
translate into a contemporary poetic idiom, but rather to imitate the
actual structure of the Pāli; each verse in the following translation is
structured by the lines and syllable counts of the original. The result,
it is hoped, is a translation which accurately conveys both the meaning
and the cadence of the Pāli original. To achieve this in English has
required considerable poetic license, to be sure; but as indicated
above, every effort has been made to mark diversions from the original
through a combination of sidenotes and square brackets.

While the online format was chosen primarily for its ability to provide
“scholarly” and “lite” (or “Kindle”) versions simultaneously, in order to meet
the needs of the different audiences that might make use of this translation, it
proved to be the solution to other, additional problems as well. Thus the
problem faced by all authors, that the text is never perfect, is mitigated by
the fact that, unlike a traditional printed book, digital publication allows for
easy on-going editing. The translation is thus put forward sooner than would
have been possible were this to be the once-and-final version, with the proviso
that it is, again, a work in progress. The translator will continue to edit the
text for years to come, and invites reader criticism to assist in making this a
better, if never truly perfect, translation. Additionally, because the
collection is so massive, a traditional printed book would be prohibitively
expensive, and would require a whole forest worth of paper. The digital format
allows the translator to distribute the translation universally, for free, which
he hopes, among other things, will encourage colleagues to put it (or selected
portions of it) into the hands of their students. Toward this end, users will
find links to easily download a <span class="abbr">PDF</span> of any individual poem, or a
<span class="abbr">PDF</span> or ePub file of the entire text. Likewise, the translator
anticipates several additional digital innovations, forthcoming, which will
further enhance the intended effect of the translation, including a soundtrack
so that the text can be listened to rather than read (as originally was
certainly the case), pictures of statues and paintings of the individual monks
and nuns such as they can be located, and visual glossary entries that
illustrate the many types of trees, uniquely Indian architectural features, and
so forth which are referred to throughout the text.
