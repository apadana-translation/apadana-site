  <p>Legends of the Buddhist Saints (<i>Apadāna</i>) is a collection of about
  six hundred autobiographical poems ascribed to the accomplished Buddhas
  and Arahants of the early Buddhist community. Composed in India in the
  Pāli language around the second century, <span class="abbr">B.C.E.</span>, the collection has
  been preserved for more than two thousand years. <i>Apadāna</i> is
  the source of many of the best-loved stories of the saints in the
  Buddhist world. It is also a particularly rich and
  colorful source for the social and religious history of ancient India.</p>
