## The Text
*Legends of the Buddhist Saints* (*Apadāna*) is a collection of about
six hundred autobiographical poems ascribed to the accomplished Buddhas
and Arahants of the early Buddhist community. Composed in India in the
Pāli language around the second century, <span class="abbr">B.C.E.</span>, the collection has
been preserved for more than two thousand years. *Apadāna* is
the source of many of the best-loved stories of the saints in the
Buddhist world. It is also a particularly rich and
colorful source for the social and religious history of ancient India.

## About the Project
This is the first-ever complete translation of *Apadāna* into a Western
language. It has been a daunting undertaking, traversing the
translator’s entire professional career, yet it admittedly remains an
imperfect work in progress. Motivated by a sense that scholars,
students, Buddhists and even the general public might enjoy and benefit
from access to this beautiful collection of ancient poetry, he has
pushed ahead, in fits and starts, to produce the present translation,
and to offer it for free to the world in this innovative online format.
