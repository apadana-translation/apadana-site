### \[15. Pañ[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}adīpikā[^1]\]

In the city, Haṃsavatī,  
I was a wanderer back then.  
From ashram to monastery,  
I wandered desiring the good. (1) \[190\]

One day when the moon was waning,  
I saw the supreme Bodhi \[Tree\].  
Bringing pleasure to \[my\] heart there,  
I sat down at that Bodhi’s roots. (2) \[191\]

Standing, with a heart of reverence,  
hands pressed together on \[my\] head,  
knowing mental happiness \[there,\]  
I then reflected in this way: (3) \[192\]

“If \[he\] has limitless virtue,  
is unique, without a rival,  
let Buddha show me a marvel;  
let him make this Bodhi \[Tree\] shine.” (4) \[193\]

When I made that aspiration,  
the Bodhi Tree did then blaze up.  
It shined forth in all directions,  
displaying[^2] every good color. (5) \[194\]

Seven nights and days I sat there,  
at the roots of that Bodhi \[Tree\],  
\[and\] when the seventh day arrived,  
I made an offering of lamps. (6) \[195\]

Setting them around my seat \[there,\]  
I \[proceeded to\] light five lamps.  
\[And\] then my lamps \[all remained\] lit,  
until the sun did rise \[again\]. (7) \[196\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (8) \[197\]

There my well-made divine mansion  
was known as “Pañ[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}adīpī”[^3] then.  
It was \[full\] sixty leagues in height,  
\[and\] thirty leagues in width back then. (9) \[198\]

Uncountable numbers of lamps  
are burning in my surroundings.  
The divine world is \[then\] lit up  
with lamp-light, up to its edges.[^4] (10) \[199\]

If when standing looking eastward,  
I should desire to see \[something\],  
above, below, also across,  
I see everything with \[my\] eyes. (11) \[200\]

As far as I should wish to see,  
things well done and things not well done,[^5]  
there’s no obstruction \[to my sight\]  
in the trees and the mountains there. (12) \[201\]

I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of eighty kings among the gods.  
I was fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of one hundred wheel-turning kings. (13) \[202\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
in my surroundings, a \[whole\] lakh  
of lamps are burning \[there\] for me. (14) \[203\]

Fallen from the world of the gods,  
I was born in a mother’s womb.  
While I was in that mother’s womb  
my eyes were open all the time. (15) \[204\]

Due to my having good karma,  
an \[entire\] hundred thousand lamps  
are lit in the lying-in room:[^6]  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] five lamps. (16) \[205\]

When my final rebirth occurred,  
I turned \[my\] mind away \[from lust\].  
I attained the unaging \[and\]  
undying cool state, nirvana. (17) \[206\]

\[When\] I was \[but\] seven years old,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.  
The Buddha ordained \[me right then\]:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] five lamps. (18) \[207\]

Meditating on a platform,[^7]  
beneath a tree, in empty spots,[^8]  
a lamp is always burning there:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] five lamps. (19) \[208\]

My “divine eye” is purified;  
I am skilled in concentration.  
I excel in special knowledges:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] five lamps. (20) \[209\]

Every achievement is achieved;  
\[my\] duty’s done, \[I’m\] undefiled.  
Five Lamps is \[now\] worshipping \[your\]  
feet, Great Hero, o Eyeful One. (21) \[210\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave \[him\] those lamps back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] five lamps. (22) \[211\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (23) \[212\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (24) \[213\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (25) \[214\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Pañ[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}adīpikā spoke these verses.

The legend of Pañ[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}adīpikā Therī is finished.

[^1]: “Five-Lamp-er.” With some very minor changes, this is identical to *Therī-apadāna* \#9, above, ascribed to a nun of the same name. I have not repeated all the footnotes here, but have altered the translation slightly to indicate the minor differences between the two texts, and have retained footnotes indicating differences in the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> version, as appropriate.

[^2]: lit., “it was”.

[^3]: “Five Lamps”

[^4]: lit., “as far as \[its extent\]”.

[^5]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads “good rebirths and bad rebirths”.

[^6]: both <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> read *sūtikāgehe* for *sūtighare* in the parallel verse in \#9, but I take the meaning to be the same so have not altered the translation.

[^7]: or “pavilion”

[^8]: lit., “in empty buildings”
