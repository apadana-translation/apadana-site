### \[26. Soṇā[^1]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
was a Master of Everything.  
\[That\] Leader arose in the world  
one hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[858\]

Born then in a millionaire’s clan,  
I was happy, honored,[^2] held dear.  
Approaching the Excellent Sage,[^3]  
I heard \[his\] words, \[sweet as\] honey. (2) \[859\]

I was overjoyed having heard  
the Victor praise the nun foremost  
of those who make a strong effort,  
doing service for the Teacher. (3) \[860\]

Then worshipping[^4] the Sambuddha,  
I aspired to \[attain\] that place.  
The Great Hero approved \[of that:\]  
“Your aspiration will succeed. (4) \[861\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (5) \[862\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
the one known by the name Soṇā  
will be the Teacher’s follower.” (6) \[863\]

At that time being overjoyed,  
as long as life, heart \[full of\] love,  
I attended on the Victor,  
the Guide, providing requisites. (7) \[864\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (8) \[865\]

And now, in \[my\] final rebirth,  
I’m born in a millionaire’s clan,  
rich, prosperous, very wealthy,  
in Śrāvasti, best of cities. (9) \[866\]

When I’d become a young woman,[^5]  
having gone to a husband’s clan,  
I was the mother of[^6] ten sons,  
very handsome and distinguished. (10) \[867\]

All of them were comfortable,  
delightful in the people’s eyes,  
brilliant even to enemies,  
needless to say, they’re loved by[^7] me. (11) \[868\]

Then, without my desiring it,[^8]  
he who was my husband went forth  
in the Buddha’s[^9] dispensation,  
surrounded[^10] by \[those\] sons[^11] \[of mine\]. (12) \[869\]

\[And\] then, alone, I reflected:  
“Enough with \[this\] life \[here\] for me,[^12]  
growing old and in misery,  
bereft of[^13] \[my\] husband \[and\] sons. (13) \[870\]

I will also go to the place  
where \[my\] husband has \[now\] arrived.”[^14]  
After reflecting in that way,  
I went forth into homelessness. (14) \[871\]

And then the nuns left me alone  
in the retreat for Buddhist nuns,  
going off with the instruction:  
“heat up the water \[while we’re gone\].” (15) \[872\]

Then bringing water I poured \[it\]  
into a small pot[^15]\[used for that\].  
After placing \[it on the hearth,\]  
seated, I then kindled my heart. (16) \[873\]

Seeing the body’s[^16] diseased-ness,  
essence-less-ness, impermanence,  
throwing off all the defilements,  
I achieved \[my\] arahantship. (17) \[874\]

Then coming \[back, those\] Buddhist nuns,  
asked \[me\] about the hot water.  
Through concentration on the fire,[^17]  
I quickly made the flame ignite. (18) \[875\]

Astonished, the \[nuns\] made that fact  
audible to the Best Victor.  
Hearing \[it,\] the Lord, overjoyed,  
spoke this verse \[about me just then:\] (19) \[876\]

“A life lived \[only\] for one day  
undertaken with strong effort,  
is better than a century  
lived inert, lacking energy.” (20) \[877\]

The Great Hero was \[greatly\] pleased  
by my exemplary conduct.  
That Great Sage said that I’m foremost  
of those who make a strong effort. (21) \[878\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (22) \[879\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (23) \[880\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (24) \[881\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Soṇā spoke these verses.

The legend of Soṇā Therī is finished.
