### \[7. Kaṭa[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}chubhikkhadāyikā[^1]\]

Taking a spoonful of begged food,  
I gave it to the Best Buddha,  
the Teacher, whose name was Tissa,  
who was wandering, begging food. (1) \[60\]

Accepting \[it,\] the Sambuddha,  
Tissa, Chief Leader of the World,  
the Teacher, standing on the road,  
uttered[^2] this thanksgiving to me: (2) \[61\]

“Giving this spoonful of begged food,  
you will go to Tāvatiṃsa.  
You’ll be fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of thirty-six kings of the gods. (3) \[62\]

You’ll be fixed in the chief queen’s place  
of fifty kings who turn the wheel.  
Everything your mind may wish for,  
you will receive \[it\] every day. (4) \[63\]

Having enjoyed \[great\] happiness,  
you will go forth, possessionless.[^3]  
Destroying all \[your\] defilements,  
you’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (5) \[64\]

Having said this, the Sambuddha,  
Tissa, Chief Leader of the World,  
the Hero, flew into the sky,  
just like a swan-king in the air. (6) \[65\]

Well-given was my superb gift;  
well-sacrificed my sacrifice.[^4]  
Giving that spoonful of begged food,  
I’ve attained the unshaking state. (7) \[66\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I gave that almsgiving back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving begged food. (8) \[67\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (9) \[68\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[69\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (11) \[70\]

Thus indeed Bhikkhunī Kaṭa[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}chubhikkhadāyikā spoke these verses.

The legend of Kaṭa[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}chubhikkhadāyikā Therī is finished.
