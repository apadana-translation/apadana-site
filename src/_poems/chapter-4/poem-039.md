### \[39. Ambapālī[^1]\]

The Great Sage was Phussa \[Buddha,\]  
\[like\] a garland of speckled rays.[^2]  
I was \[that Buddha’s own\] sister,  
born in \[Buddha’s\] kṣatriyan clan. (1) \[1307\]

Having listened to his Teaching,  
with a mind that was very clear,  
giving \[him\] a large alms-giving  
I aspired to achieve beauty. (2) \[1308\]

Thirty-one aeons in the past,[^3]  
Sikhi, Chief Leader of the World,  
arose, the \[Bright\] Lamp of the World,  
the Three Worlds’ Refuge, the Victor. (3) \[1309\]

I’m then born in a brahmin clan,  
in lovely Āruṇa City.  
Angered \[about something,\] I cursed  
a nun with liberated mind. (4) \[1310\]

Misbehaved like a prostitute,  
I dirtied the dispensation.[^4]  
Having thus cursed \[the nun\] like that,  
because of that evil karma,  
I went to a horrific hell,  
full of terrible suffering.  
Fallen from there, \[again\] reborn  
human,[^5] I was an ascetic.[^6] (5-6) \[1311-1312\]

For ten thousand \[different\] lifetimes,  
I was fixed in prostitution;  
thus I was not freed from evil,  
as though \[I’d\] eaten[^7] strong poison. (7) \[1313\]

In Kassapa’s dispensation,[^8]  
I practiced celibate \[nunhood\][^9].  
Due to that karma, I was born  
in the city of the thirty.[^10] (8) \[1314\]

When \[my\] last rebirth was attained,  
come to be spontaneously,[^11]  
I was born amidst mango boughs;  
therefore I was “Mango-Guarded.” (9) \[1315\]

Along with ten million beings,  
gone forth in the dispensation,[^12]  
I attained the unshaking state,  
Buddha’s legitimate daughter. (10) \[1316\]

I’ve mastered the superpowers  
\[like\] the “divine ear” element.  
I’m also a master, Great Sage,[^13]  
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (11) \[1317\]

I remember \[my\] former lives;  
\[my\] “divine eye” is purified.  
All the defilements are destroyed;  
\[I\] will not be reborn again. (12) \[1318\]

In meaning and in the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
\[this\] knowledge of mine was produced  
in your presence, O Great Hero. (13) \[1319\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (14) \[1320\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (15) \[1321\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (16) \[1322\]

Thus indeed the bhikkhunī Ambapālī spoke these verses.

The legend of the bhikkhunī Ambapālī is finished
