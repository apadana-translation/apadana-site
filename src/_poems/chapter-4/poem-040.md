### \[40. Selā[^1]\]

In this \[present\] lucky aeon,  
Brahma’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,  
\[the Buddha\] known as Kassapa  
was born, the Best of Debaters. (1) \[1323\]

I’m born in a lay Buddhist clan,  
in Śrāvasti, superb city.  
Having seen that superb Victor,  
and having heard \[him\] preach \[*Dhamma*,\] (2a-d)[^2] \[1324\]

gone to that Hero for refuge,  
I undertook morality.  
Whenever that Great Hero, in  
the midst of the great populace, (2e-f, 3a-b) \[1325\]

the Bull of Men was explaining  
his own supreme Awakening,  
things which formerly were unheard,  
starting with “\[life is\] suffering,” (3c-f) \[1326\]

hearing that, \[and\] taking \[it\] up,  
insight, thinking, wisdom, science,  
and intuition rose in me,  
and I asked the monks \[about them\]. (4) \[1327\]

In Kassapa’s dispensation,[^3]  
I practiced celibate \[nunhood\].[^4]  
Due to that karma, I was born  
in the city of the thirty.[^5] (5) \[1328\]

And now, in \[my\] final rebirth,  
born in a large millionaire’s clan  
having approached and having heard  
the Buddha’s great truth-filled Teaching, (6) \[1329\]

having gone forth, in no long time,  
I understood truth’s foundations;  
casting away all defilements,  
I achieved \[my\] arahantship. (7) \[1330\]

I’ve mastered the superpowers  
\[like\] the “divine ear” element.  
I’m also a master, Great Sage,[^6]  
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (8) \[1331\]

I remember \[my\] former lives;  
\[my\] “divine eye” is purified.  
All the defilements are destroyed;  
\[I\] will not be reborn again. (9) \[1332\]

In meaning and in the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
\[this\] knowledge of mine was produced  
in your presence, O Great Hero. (10) \[1333\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (11) \[1334\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (12) \[1335\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (13) \[1336\]

Thus indeed the bhikkhunī Selā spoke these verses.
