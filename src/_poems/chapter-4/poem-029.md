### \[29. Ten Thousand Buddhist Nuns Headed Up by Yasovatī[^1]\]

One hundred thousand aeons \[and\]  
four incalculable \[aeons\]  
hence, Dīpaṅkara, the Victor,  
the Leader of the World was born. (1) \[1029\]

Dīpaṅkara, the Great Hero,  
the Guide, prophesied back then that  
Sumedha and Sumittā would  
be the same in pleasure and pain. (2) \[1030\]

Seeing and going about in  
the world together with \[its\] gods,  
meeting us was included in  
\[what Buddha\] prophesied for them. (3) \[1031\]

“You,[^2] \[Sumedha,\] will be all of  
our husbands met in the future;  
we’ll all be your desirable  
wives, saying what is dear \[to you\].” (4) \[1032\]

All this alms-giving and morals,  
meditation cultivated;  
for a long time our everything  
has been abandoned, O Great Sage. (5) \[1033\]

Scents and ointments, garlands \[and\] lamps,  
which were fashioned out of \[pure\] gold,  
whatever it was we wished for,  
all was abandoned, O Great Sage. (6) \[1034\]

And other karma \[we\] have done,  
and \[every\] human enjoyment,  
for a long time our everything  
has been abandoned, O Great Sage. (7) \[1035\]

Transmigrating in varied births,  
much good karma[^3] was done by us;  
experiencing \[you as\] husband,  
transmigrating life after life, (8) \[1036\]

When \[our\] last lifetime was attained,  
in the home of the Śākyan prince,[^4]  
we arose in various clans,  
attractive celestial nymphs.[^5] (9) \[1037\]

We’ve attained fame, with foremost gain;  
we’re worshipped[^6] and well-respected.  
We are always venerated,  
receiving things to eat and drink. (10) \[1038\]

After abandoning the home,  
going[^7] forth into homelessness,  
when eight months[^8] had not yet elapsed,  
we all realized nirvana. (11) \[1039\]

Always worshipped \[and\] respected,  
\[we\] receive things to eat and drink,  
and clothes \[and also\] lodgings \[too;\]  
\[folks\] bring \[us\] all the requisites. (12) \[1040\]

Our[^9] defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
we are living without constraint. (13) \[1041\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for us.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[we have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[1042\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[we have\] done what the Buddha taught! (15) \[1043\]

Thus indeed ten thousand Buddhist nuns headed up by Yasovatī spoke these verses face-to-face with the Blessed One.

The legend of ten thousand Buddhist nuns headed up by Yasodharā is finished
