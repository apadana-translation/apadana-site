### \[38. Puṇṇikā[^1]\]

Gone forth in the dispensation  
of the Blessed One, Vipassi,  
and of Sikhi and Vessabhu,  
the Sage Kakusandha \[Buddha\],  
Konāgamana, Neutral One,  
and of the Buddha Kassapa,  
\[I’m\] a nun endowed with morals,  
clever, with senses \[well-\]controlled. (1-2) \[1287-1288\]

Learned bearer of the Teaching,  
asker of the Teaching’s meaning,[^2]  
studier of, listener to  
and worshipper of the Teaching, (3) \[1289\]

amidst the people I’m preaching  
in the Victor’s dispensation.  
Because of \[my\] profound learning,  
I despised kind associates.[^3] (4) \[1290\]

And now, in \[my\] final rebirth,  
I am a water-jug slave-girl,  
born in Śrāvasti, best city,  
in Anāthapiṇḍi\[ka\]’s house.[^4] (5) \[1291\]

Gone \[bearing\] a load of water,  
I saw an erudite brahmin,  
\[standing\] in the water, chilly.  
After seeing him I said this: (6) \[1292\]

“Bearing water I always go  
down to the water in the cold,  
scared with fear of the master’s[^5] stick,  
oppressed by fear of faults called out. (7) \[1293\][^6]

Of what are you afraid, brahmin?  
Limbs shivering you always go  
down to the water, so much cold  
being experienced by you.” (8) \[1294\][^7]

“You certainly know, Puṇṇikā.  
You are asking[^8] me who’s doing  
wholesome karma and warding off[^9]  
karma with evil \[consequence\]. (9) \[1295\][^10]

Whether he is old is young,  
one who performs evil karma,  
just by sprinkling[^11] himself with water,  
is freed from \[that\] evil karma.” (10) \[1296\][^12]

I spoke a verse[^13] of *Dhamma* to  
\[him\] coming out of the water.  
Hearing that \[he\] was very moved;  
gone forth, he was an arahant. (11) \[1297\]

When I was born in the slave clan,  
\[I\] completed the full hundred.[^14]  
Therefore they named me “Completer,”[^15]  
and freed me from \[my\] slavery. (12) \[1298\]

Getting the millionaire’s consent,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
After not a very long time,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (13) \[1299\]

I’ve mastered the superpowers  
\[like\] the “divine ear” element.  
I’m also a master, Great Sage,  
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (14) \[1300\]

I remember \[my\] former lives;  
\[my\] “divine eye” is purified.  
All the defilements are destroyed;  
\[I\] will not be reborn again. (15) \[1301\]

In meaning and in the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
\[this\] knowledge of mine was produced  
in your presence, O Great Hero. (16) \[1302\]

Through meditation, very wise;  
through what has been heard, one’s learned;  
but karma will not be destroyed[^16]  
through the pride of those of high birth. (17) \[1303\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (18) \[1304\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (19) \[1305\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (20) \[1306\]

Thus indeed the bhikkhunī Puṇṇikā spoke these verses.
