### \[35. Sukkā[^1]\]

Ninety-one aeons ago the  
Leader, whose name was Vipassi,  
arose, the One Good to Look At,[^2]  
the One with Eyes for Everything. (1) \[1214\]

I was then in Bandhumatī,  
born in an undistinguished clan.  
Having heard the Sage’s Teaching,  
I went forth into homelessness. (2) \[1215\]

Learned bearer of the Teaching,  
good preacher, varied discourser,  
I was a \[nun\] who practiced the  
dispensation of the Buddha. (3) \[1216\]

Then giving many *Dhamma*-talks  
with friendship to the populace,  
fallen from there I was reborn,  
full of splendor, in Tusitā. (4) \[1217\]

Thirty-one aeons hence, Sikhi,  
a Heap of Fire,[^3] burning with fame,  
the Victor, the Best Debater,  
\[the Buddha,\] arose in[^4] the world. (5) \[1218\]

At that very time going forth,  
skilled in Buddha’s dispensation,  
making the Victor’s sayings shine,  
I then went to the thirty \[gods\]. (6) \[1219\]

The Leader \[named\] Vessabhu, \[too,\]  
arose thirty-one aeons hence.  
And then as well I was the same:[^5]  
\[a Buddhist nun\] with vast knowledge. (7) \[1220\]

Gone forth, a *Dhamma*-bearer, I  
made Buddha’s[^6] dispensation shine.  
Gone to the lovely gods’ city,  
I experienced great comfort. (8) \[1221\]

In this \[present\] lucky aeon,  
Kakusandha, Supreme Victor,[^7]  
arose, the Excellent Leopard,[^8]  
and then as well I was the same. (9) \[1222\]

Gone forth, \[I\] illuminated  
the Sage’s thought, as long as life.[^9]  
Fallen from there, I went as far  
as the sphere of the thirty \[gods\]. (10) \[1223\]

\[And\] in this very same aeon  
the Leader Konāgamana  
arose \[next,\] the Excellent Lamp,[^10]  
Ultimate among all beings. (11) \[1224\]

At that time too, going forth in  
the Neutral One’s dispensation,  
learned bearer of *Dhamma*, I  
made Buddha’s[^11] dispensation shine. (12) \[1225\]

Also in this \[lucky\] aeon  
Kassapa \[Buddha,\] Seventh Sage,  
arose, the Refuge of the World,[^12]  
Non-Hostile One,[^13] Ender of Death.[^14] (13) \[1226\]

Gone forth in the dispensation  
of that Hero Among Men[^15] as well,  
\[I\] learned the good Teaching by heart,  
was confident in inquiry, (14) \[1227\]

very moral, also modest,  
\[very\] skilled in the three trainings,[^16]  
giving many talks on *Dhamma*  
with friendship as long as I lived.[^17] (15) \[1228\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (16) \[1229\]

And now, in \[my\] final rebirth,  
in Giribbaja,[^18] best city,  
\[I was\] born to rich millionaires,[^19]  
with a huge quantity of gems. (17) \[1230\]

When \[Gotama,\] the World’s Leader,  
surrounded by one thousand monks,  
entered \[the city,\] Rajgir,[^20] he  
was praised by the thousand-eyed \[god:\][^21] (18) \[1231\]

“The Restrained One,[^22] with former ascetics[^23] restrained;  
the Liberated One,[^24] with those liberated;  
\[who had\] the same color as a coin[^25] made of gold,  
the Blessed One entered Rajagaha city.” (19) \[1232\][^26]

Seeing the Buddha’s majesty,  
and hearing him, Heap of Virtues,[^27]  
pleasing my heart in the Buddha,  
I worshipped[^28] \[him\] with all \[my\] strength. (20) \[1233\]

At \[some\] moment after that, in  
the presence of Dhammadinnā,[^29]  
having gone forth from \[my own\] home,  
I went forth into homelessness. (21) \[1234\]

I destroyed \[all\] the defilements  
while \[my\] hair was being cut off.  
Going forth, in no long time, I learned  
\[Buddha’s\] entire dispensation. (22) \[1235\]

After that I preached the *Dhamma*  
in a huge gathering of folks.  
While *Dhamma* was being preached, there  
was insight into the Teaching.[^30] (23) \[1236\]

Seeing varied thousands of folks  
\[achieving insight,\] astonished,  
a spirit,[^31] very pleased by me,  
roaming about Rajgir \[said this\]: (24) \[1237\]

“Why are these people in Rajgir  
acting like nymphs drunk on honey,  
unless[^32] they’re honoring[^33] Sukkā,  
\[who’s\] preaching the ambrosial state? (25) \[1238\]

Methinks the wise are drinking that  
irresistible and unmixed  
strength-bestower, like travelers  
\[drink rainwater from\] a raincloud.” (26) \[1239\]

I’ve mastered the superpowers  
\[like\] the “divine ear” element.  
I’m also a master, Great Sage,[^34]  
of the knowledge in others’ hearts. (27) \[1240\]

I remember \[my\] former lives;  
\[my\] “divine eye” is purified.  
All the defilements are destroyed;  
\[I\] will not be reborn again. (28) \[1241\]

In meaning and in the Teaching,  
etymology and preaching,  
\[this\] knowledge of mine was produced  
in your presence, O Great Hero. (29) \[1242\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (30) \[1243\]

Being in Best Buddha's presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (31) \[1244\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (32) \[1245\]

Thus indeed the bhikkhunī Sukkā spoke these verses.

The legend of Sukkā Therī[^35] is finished

Cf. the note to *Thera-apadāna* \[6131\] on this rather uncharacteristically loose, and rare but repeated, *Apadāna* Buddha-epithet (or epithets). Does the variation suggest a lack of meaning in the epithet itself (in *Apadāna* the leopard \[as *dīpi*\] usually appears as part of a list of wild animals, not \[unlike say the lion, elephant, swan, bull\] as part of a Buddha-epithet)

[^26]: these lines (41 syllables in <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>, 40 syllables in <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> \[which omits the *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>a* after *purāṇajaṭilehi*\]) are presented by both <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> as a single verse, though they break the two-footed lines differently and I am at a loss for how to understand the “verse” metrically. A quote from some prose text? A verse in more complex meter, garbled in transmission? I have translated into the closest approximation of the latter possibility in *Apadāna*, namely a 12-12-12-12 verse (which would suggest the possible loss of seven syllables \[in the case of <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>’ reading\] or eight syllables \[in the case of <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>’s reading\] sometime comparatively early in the transmission process (since it affects all the extant mss.) In addition to conforming to a verse-form occasionally encountered elsewhere in *Apadāna*, this implicit 12-12-12-12 structure works very nicely for the basic units that then make up the four discrete feet.

[^27]: *taŋ…guṇasañ<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ayaŋ*

[^28]: lit., “did *pūjā*”

[^30]: lit., “there was an \[achieving of\] insight into the *Dhamma* of twenty million.” *Dhammâbhisamaya*, “insight into the *Dhamma*” or “entry into the *Dhamma*” or “comprehension of the *Dhamma”* or “penetration into the *Dhamma”* refers to the achievement of a firm grasp on the essentials of the Teaching. It is used as a technical term in the account of each Buddha in the *Buddhavaṃsa*, one among many categories of Buddha-achievement enumerated there.

[^31]: *yakkho*

[^32]: *ye…na*, lit., “those who have not”

[^33]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *payirupāsanti* breaks the meter; <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> *upāsanti* does not. The two are essentially the same verb, the former with an additional *pari*&lt;*payir*
