### \[253. [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itapūjaka[^1]\]

The Buddha known as Ānanda,  
the Self-Become, Unconquered One,  
passed away[^2] in \[his\] forest haunt,  
in the woods, devoid of people. (1) \[2507\]

Coming here from the world of gods  
\[and\] having made a pyre[^3] I then  
did burn \[his\] body in that place  
and I attended upon \[it\].[^4] (2) \[2508\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2509\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2510\]

Thus indeed Venerable [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itapūjaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itapūjaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Pyre-Worshipper”. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *[C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itakapūjaka*. which gets the proper word for pyre (*[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}ita*) even though <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> retains in v. 2 \[2508\] the form *[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itaṃ*

[^2]: “reached nirvana”

[^3]: taking *[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itaŋ* as *[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itakaṃ*

[^4]: lit., “I made attendance upon \[it\].” *Sakkāra* = hospitality, attendance, service upon, i.e., cleaning it up, placing flowers there, providing it with water and food offerings, etc.
