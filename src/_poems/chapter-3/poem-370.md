### \[367. {370.}[^1] Salaḷapupphiya[^2]\]

On <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andabhāgā River’s bank  
I was a *kinnara*[^3] back then.  
And then I saw the God of Gods,  
Bull of Men, walking back and forth. (1) \[3214\]

Plucking \[a\] *salaḷa* flower,  
I gifted \[it\] to the Buddha.  
The Great Hero, \[the Buddha\] sniffed  
\[that\] divinely-scented flower.[^4] (2) \[3215\]

Accepting them the Sambuddha  
Vipassi, Leader of the World,  
the Great Hero, \[the Buddha\] sniffed,  
conscious[^5] of what I was wishing.[^6] (3) \[3216\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I worshipped \[him\], the Best Biped.  
Pressing both my hands together  
I climbed up the mountain again. (4) \[3217\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (5) \[3218\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[3219\]

Thus indeed Venerable Salaḷapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Salaḷapupphiya Thera is finished.
