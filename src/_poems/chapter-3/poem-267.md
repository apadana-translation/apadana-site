### \[267. Javahaŋsaka[^1]\]

On [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}andabhāgā River’s bank  
I was a forester back then.  
I saw the Buddha, Siddhattha,  
traveling across the sky \[there\]. (1) \[2565\]

Raising my hands pressed together,  
gazing upon the Sage so Great,  
bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart  
I gave the Leader reverence. (2) \[2566\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I revered the Bull Among Men,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of reverence. (3) \[2567\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2568\]

Thus indeed Venerable Javahaŋsaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Javahaŋsaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Speedy Swan-er,” apparently an allusion to the Buddha’s movement across the sky, the witnessing of which serves as this monk’s foundational good deed.
