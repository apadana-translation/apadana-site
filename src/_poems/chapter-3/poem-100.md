### \[100. Buddhūpaṭṭhāka\]

\[Back then\] I was the conch-blower  
for Vipassi, the Blessed One,  
constantly engaged in service  
to the Well-Gone One, the Great Sage. (1) \[1606\]

Look at the fruit of that service  
to the Neutral One, the World-Chief:  
sixty thousand *turiya*-drums  
are constantly attending me. (2) \[1607\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I served the Great Sage in that way,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of doing service. (3) \[1608\]

In the twenty-fourth[^1] aeon hence  
there were sixteen \[different\] kings \[then\];  
\[all\] were named Mahānigghosa,[^2]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength. (4) \[1609\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1610\]

Thus indeed Venerable Buddhūpaṭṭhāka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Buddhūpaṭṭhāka Thera is finished.
