### \[93. Aḍḍha[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}elaka[^1]\]

I gave a half \[a piece\] of cloth  
to Tissa, the Blessed One \[then\].  
I was extremely miserable,  
\[and\] plagued with an awful odor. (1) \[1566\]

Giving that half a cloth I thrilled  
in heaven for a \[whole\] aeon.  
During the aeons that remained  
I completed that good karma.[^2] (2) \[1567\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I donated that cloth back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving cloth. (3) \[1568\]

In the forty-ninth aeon \[hence\]  
there were thirty-two lords of men,  
kings who turned the wheel \[of the law\]  
known as Samanta-Odanā.[^3] (4) \[1569\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1570\]

Thus indeed Venerable Aḍḍha[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}elaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Aḍḍha[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}elaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Half-Cloth-er”

[^2]: lit., “That wholesomeness \[kusala\] was finished by me”. The meaning is that the good effects of the deed were not exhausted by the aeon in heaven; in the subsequent aeons too he experienced good results from it.

[^3]: “Boiled Rice on All Sides.” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> read Samantā-[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}-Chadana, “Covered on All Sides,” which would better fit the nature of the original good deed, and is perhaps to be preferred here.
