### \[12. Ekatthambhika[^1]\]

The Blessed One \[named\] Siddhattha  
had a large group of followers.  
They had taken \[the lay\] refuge  
with faith in the Thus-Gone Buddha. (1) \[686\]

They all gathered and decided  
to build a hut[^2] for the Teacher.  
Still in need of one more pillar[^3]  
they were searching the thick forest. (2) \[687\]

Having seen them in the forest  
I then went up to that group \[there\].  
Pressing both my hands together  
I made inquiries of that group. (3) \[688\]

Those morally-restrained layfolk  
asked by me then gave \[their\] reply,  
“we desire to build a *māḷa*  
but we are \[still\] one pillar short.” (4) \[689\]

“Give me the one pillar \[duty\];  
I will give it to the Teacher.  
I will take that pillar \[to him\],  
all of you please \[now\] be at ease.” (5) \[690\]

Pleased \[and\] with minds \[full of\] delight  
they felled that pillar for me \[there\],  
then having turned around to leave  
they went back to their own houses. (6) \[691\]

Not long after that big group left  
I then did give \[him\] that pillar.  
I was the first one to raise it,  
happy, \[and\] with a happy heart. (7) \[692\]

Because of the pleasure in \[my\] heart  
I was born in a god’s mansion.  
That lofty residence of mine  
was one hundred stories in height. (8) \[693\]

When the drums are being beaten,  
I am then being entertained.[^4]  
I was the king, Yasodhara,[^5]  
in the fifty-fifth aeon \[thence\]. (9) \[694\]

There too I had a residence  
which was seven stories in height.  
Appointed with fine gabled cells  
there was one pillar, mind’s delight. (10) \[695\]

In the twenty-first aeon \[thence\]  
I was the king[^6] known as Udena.  
There too I had a residence  
which was a hundred stories tall. (11) \[696\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
I experience all of that;  
that is the fruit of one pillar. (12) \[697\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that pillar back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that is the fruit of one pillar. (13) \[698\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (14) \[699\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekatthambhika Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekatthambhika Thera is finished.
