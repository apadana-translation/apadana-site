### \[22. Upavāna\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
Who Had Crossed Over Everything,  
the Sambuddha went fully out[^1]  
like a fire finished burning. (1) \[865\]

Many people came together  
venerating the Thus-Gone-One.  
They made a well-made pyre[^2] \[for him\]  
\[then\] lifted \[his\] body \[on it\]. (2) \[866\]

Doing the needful with the corpse  
they gathered \[all\] the relics there.  
\[Then\] all the people, with \[their\] kings,  
constructed the Buddha’s stupa. (3) \[867\]

The first \[casket\][^3] was made of gold,  
the second was made of gemstone.  
The third was made out of silver,  
the fourth was made of crystal. (4) \[868\]

The fifth \[stupa\] which was built there  
was made of rubies fixed in glass.  
The sixth was made of all the gems  
with a \[large\] cat’s-eye[^4] on the top. (5) \[869\]

There was a railing made of gold;  
\[its\] legs were made out of gemstones.  
That stupa, all \[encased\] in gold,  
\[rose up\] in height a \[full\] league tall. (6) \[870\]

The gods then got together there  
and counseled one another \[thus\]:  
“we shall construct a stupa too  
for the World-Chief, the Neutral One. (7) \[871\]

\[But\] there are no single relics;  
the body is in one lump \[now\].  
We’ll enlarge this very stupa  
of the Buddha, using \[fine\] gold.” (8) \[872\]

The gods, using the seven gems,  
raised it another league \[taller\].  
That stupa, which was two leagues tall,  
dispelled the darkness \[with its shine\]. (9) \[873\]

The snake-gods[^5] then assembled there  
and counseled one another \[thus\]:  
“The people and also the gods  
constructed the Buddha’s stupa. (10) \[874\]

Do not let us be negligent;  
heedful, \[and\] with the lesser gods,  
we too shall enlarge \[this\] stupa  
of the World-Chief, the Neutral One.” (11) \[875\]

Gathering themselves together  
they covered the Buddha’s stupa  
with the two types of blue sapphire[^6]  
and with the *jotirasa* gem.[^7] (12) \[876\]

At that point Buddha’s *[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}etiya*  
was made entirely of gems.  
In height it welled up three[^8] leagues \[tall\]  
lighting up \[the whole universe\]. (13) \[877\]

\[Then\] *garuḷas*[^9] got together  
and counseled one another \[thus\]:  
“The men and gods and snake-gods too  
constructed the Buddha’s stupa. (14) \[878\]

Do not let us be negligent;  
heedful, \[and\] with the lesser gods,  
we too shall enlarge \[this\] stupa  
of the World-Chief, the Neutral One.” (15) \[879\]

That stupa made only of gems  
they gilded on the top \[right then\].  
They too increased by one \[whole\] league  
the height of the Buddha’s stupa. (16) \[880\]

Then rising up four leagues \[in height\]  
that Buddha-stupa shined \[so\] bright.  
It illumined all directions  
just like the risen raying sun. (17) \[881\]

\[Then\] *kumbhaṇḍas* got together  
and counseled one another thus:  
“The people and also the gods  
the snake-gods and the *garuḷas* \[882\]

themselves built a superb stupa  
for \[him\], the Best of the Buddhas.  
Do not let us be negligent;  
heedful, \[and\] with the lesser gods, \[883\]

we too shall enlarge \[this\] stupa  
of the World-Chief, the Neutral One.  
We’ll cover the entire extent  
of the Buddha’s stupa with gems.” \[884\]

They too increased by one \[whole\] league  
the height of the Buddha’s stupa.  
\[Now\] rising up five leagues \[in height\]  
that Buddha-stupa shined forth \[bright\]. \[885\]

Then spirits[^10] got together there  
and counseled one another \[thus\]:  
“The people, gods, and snake-gods too,  
the *garūḷas* and *kumbhaṇḍas* (18)[^11] \[886\]

themselves built a superb stupa  
for the World-Chief, the Neutral One.  
Do not let us be negligent;  
heedful, \[and\] with the lesser gods, (19) \[887\]

we too shall enlarge \[this\] stupa  
of the World-Chief, the Neutral One.  
We’ll cover the entire extent  
of Buddha’s stupa with crystal.” (20) \[888\]

They too increased by one \[whole\] league  
the height of the Buddha’s stupa.  
\[Now\] rising up six[^12] leagues \[in height\]  
that Buddha-stupa shined forth \[bright\]. (21) \[889\]

Then assembled the music-nymphs[^13]  
\[who\] counseled one another \[thus\]:  
“Those born of Manu, and the gods,  
snake-gods*, *kumbhaṇḍas*, *guyhakas*[^14] (22) \[890\]

all constructed Buddha’s stupa;  
we’ve done nothing in that regard.  
We too shall enlarge \[this\] stupa  
of the World-Chief, the Neutral One.” (23) \[891\]

They constructed seven railings  
\[and\] made the legs \[for it as well\].  
Then that stupa the music-nymphs  
made fully \[encased\] in \[fine\] gold. (24) \[892\]

\[Now\] rising seven leagues \[in height\]  
that Buddha-stupa shined forth \[bright\].  
One could not tell the day from night;  
there always was \[its strong\] bright light. (25) \[893\]

Its brilliance actually out-shined  
the moon and the sun and the stars.  
By day that lamp was blazing forth  
for a hundred leagues \[all\] around. (26) \[894\]

At that time, whichever people  
were worshipping that stupa \[there\]  
did not have to climb[^15] that stupa;  
they were \[just\] held up in the air. (27) \[895\]

Their flags or wreaths of flowers \[there\]  
were offered up \[into the air\]  
by spirit[^16] Abhisammata  
who had been placed \[there\] by the gods. (28) \[896\]

They could not see the spirit[^17] \[there\];  
they see the wreaths \[just\] flying by.  
Seeing them go by in this way,  
all of them go on to good states. (29) \[897\]

People with faith in Buddha’s words,  
and pleased in the dispensation,  
wishing to see the miracle  
are worshipping that stupa \[there\]. (30) \[898\]

At that time I was a speaker  
\[and I\] lived in Haṃsavatī.  
Seeing those delighted people  
this \[good\] thought then occurred to me: (31) \[899\]

“He is lofty, the Blessed One,  
who has a relic-womb[^18] like this;  
these people are very happy  
doing their rites with devotion. (32) \[900\]

I too shall do a ritual  
for the World-Chief, the Neutral One,  
and in the future, I shall be  
one of the heirs to[^19] his doctrines.” (33) \[901\]

I had my upper garment washed  
by one whose job was washing clothes  
\[and\] having stuck it on bamboo  
I raised a flag up in the sky. (34) \[902\]

Grabbing it, Abhisammata  
raised up my flag into the sky.  
Seeing it[^20] flutter in the wind,  
among those folks I smiled a lot. (35) \[903\]

Bringing pleasure to \[my\] mind there  
I \[then\] approached a \[Buddhist\] monk.  
Worshipping that monk I inquired  
what that flag’s result would become. (36) \[904\]

He told me of religious joy,  
generating \[great\] bliss for me.  
“You always will experience  
the fruit of \[your gift of\] that flag.” (37) \[905\]

\[He said\], “The army, with four parts —  
tusker, soldier, chariot, horse —  
will wait on you permanently;  
that is the fruit of a flag-gift. (38) \[906\]

Sixty thousand instruments[^21] \[and\]  
well-decorated kettle-drums[^22]  
will attend you permanently;  
that is the fruit of a flag-gift. (39) \[907\]

And women \[too, all\] well-made-up  
numbering eighty-six thousand,  
with varied clothes and ornaments,  
wearing earrings bearing gemstones, (40) \[908\]

with long eyelashes, lovely smiles[^23]  
and slim waists, pleasant to look at[^24]  
will wait upon you constantly:  
that is the fruit of a flag-gift. (41) \[909\]

You’ll delight in the world of gods  
for thirty thousand aeons \[hence\].  
Eighty times as the king of gods  
you will exercise divine rule. (42) \[910\]

A thousand times you’re going to be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\],  
\[and you will have\] much local rule  
innumerable by counting. (43) \[911\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (44) \[912\]

Falling down from the world of gods,  
incited by \[your\] wholesome roots,  
\[and\] bound up with your good karma  
you will be Brahma’s kinsman \[then\]. (45) \[913\]

Discarding eight hundred million  
\[and\] many slaves \[and\] workers \[too\],  
you will renounce in the teaching  
of Gotama the Blessed One. (46) \[914\]

Satisfying the Sambuddha,  
Gotama, the Bull of Śākyas,  
you’ll be known as Upavāna  
a follower of the Teacher.” (47) \[915\]

Karma done a hundred thousand  
\[aeons hence\] showed me \[its\] fruit here:  
well-liberated, arrow-quick,  
I have destroyed my defilements. (48) \[916\]

When I was a wheel-turning king,  
lord over the four continents,  
for three leagues in all directions  
flags were always seen by me \[then\]. (49) \[917\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I did that \[good\] karma then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that is the fruit of a flag-gift. (50) \[918\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (51) \[919\]

Thus indeed Venerable Upavāna Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Upavāna Thera is finished.

[^1]: *parinibbuto*.

[^2]: *[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itaka*, heap, shrine

[^3]: the text does not stipulate the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth *what*, and the cty. sees no need to explain. Relic finds as at Pipphrawa, as well as the context (in which there is clearly a single stupa) would suggest that these were reliquaries inside reliquaries inside reliquaries, each encasing the former ones like Russian nesting dolls, until the whole thing was covered with gold.

[^4]: *masāragallassa*, *masāragalla* = Sinh. *maesirigala*

[^5]: *nāgā*

[^6]: lit., “with *Indanīla* and *mahānīla*” = “Indra Blue” and “Great Blue”

[^7]: see above, n. to \[839\]

[^8]: <dfn id="#BJTS"><abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr></dfn> reads thirty leagues

[^9]: <dfn id="#PTS"><abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr></dfn> omits the *garuḷas*, and as a result the height of the stupa increases from five to seven leagues, skipping six. <a href="#BJTS" class="abbr">BJTS</a> includes the *garuḷas*, which makes the numbering sequence complete. In <a href="#PTS" class="abbr">PTS</a> this is the *kumbhaṇḍas* rather than the *garuḷas*, but otherwise the text is the same.

[^10]: *yakkhā*

[^11]: <a href="#PTS" class="abbr">PTS</a> omits *kumbhaṇḍas* from this list, conflating them with *garuḷas*; I follow <a href="#BJTS" class="abbr">BJTS</a> in the last two feet.

[^12]: <a href="#PTS" class="abbr">PTS</a> reads five, in keeping with its elision of the *garuḷas*

[^13]: *gandhabbā*

[^14]: <a href="#BJTS" class="abbr">BJTS</a> and <a href="#PTS" class="abbr">PTS</a> alt. reads *garuḷā* for *guyhakā*

[^15]: an allusion to the practice that seems to have been current at the early post-Aśokan stupas, namely climbing the railing attached to the sides of the stupa in order to circumambulate and place offerings upon its dome.

[^16]: *yakkha*

[^17]: *yakkha*

[^18]: i.e., stupa.

[^19]: lit., “in”.

[^20]: lit., “the flag”.

[^21]: *turiya*, musical instruments

[^22]: *bheri*

[^23]: *hasulā* = ? Cf. RD *hasula*, s.v., which following Kern treats this as a corrupted reading of *bhamuka*, “eyebrows” or “thick eyebrows”, often found in combination with the term for “long eyelashes” (*aḷārapamha*).

[^24]: RD gives “good hips,” referring to this text. I don’t see the warrant, and take the term *susaññā* from *saññā*, sense, perception, as does <a href="#BJTS" class="abbr">BJTS</a>
