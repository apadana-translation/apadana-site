### \[273. [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}aṅgoṭakiya[^1]\]

While dwelling amidst the mountains,  
living off of \[food from\] the sea,  
not wishing to fall backwards I  
did make a donation, a box.[^2] (1) \[2591\]

After giving a box of blooms  
to Siddhattha, the Greatest Sage,  
the Pitier of All Beings,  
an aeon I joyed in heaven. (2) \[2592\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave that box \[to Buddha\] then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[giving\] a box. (3) \[2593\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2594\]

Thus indeed Venerable [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}aṅgoṭakiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}aṅgoṭakiya Thera is finished.
