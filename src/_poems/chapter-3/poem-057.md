### \[57. Pañ[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}adīpika[^1]\]

After praising the true Teaching  
of Buddha Padumuttara  
who took pity on all creatures,  
I was one who had upright views. (1) \[1307\]

I donated a gift of lamps  
to surround the \[great\] Bodhi Tree.  
Believing \[in the Buddha\] I  
\[then\] lit[^2] \[those\] lamps all of the time. (2) \[1308\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
torches are carried[^3] in the sky:  
that is the fruit of giving lamps. (3) \[1309\]

\[Right\] through walls, \[also right\] through rocks,  
\[and\] passing over mountain\[-top\]s,[^4]  
I can see[^5] in all directions  
\[even\] one hundred leagues \[distant\]. (4) \[1310\]

Through the rest of that \[good\] karma  
I have attained arahantship.[^6]  
I’m bearing my last body in  
the Biped-Lord’s dispensation. (5) \[1312[^7]\]

Thirty-four hundred aeons \[thence\]  
I was known as Sata[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}akkhu;[^8]  
I was a king with great power,  
a wheel-turner who had great strength. (6) \[1311\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1313\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pañ[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}adīpika Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pañ[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}adīpika Thera is finished.
