### \[50. Cunda\]

Having had a festoon work[^1] made  
for the World’s Best, the Neutral One,  
the Blessed One \[named\] Siddhattha,  
I covered it with jasmine flowers. (1) \[1239\]

After \[I\] finished \[placing\] flowers,  
I \[then\] gave it to the Buddha.  
Picking up the remaining flowers,  
I offered \[them\] to the Buddha. (2) \[1240\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart  
I gave that floral festoon work  
to the Buddha, World’s Chief Leader,  
like a festoon work \[made\] of gold. (3) \[1241\]

The Sambuddha, With Doubt Dispelled,  
Honored by Those Who’ve Crossed the Flood,[^2]  
seated in the monks’ Assembly,  
spoke these verses \[about me then\]: (4) \[1242\]

“I’ll relate details of him who  
gave me a floral festoon work  
permeated with divine scents;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (5) \[1243\]

When he’s fallen from here, this man  
will go on to the world of gods,  
a god-assembly around \[him\],  
scattered with jasmine flowers \[there\]. (6) \[1244\]

His residence, jutting up tall,  
will be made of gold and gemstones.  
That divine mansion will blaze forth,  
illumined by \[his\] good karma.[^3] (7) \[1245\]

He will exercise divine rule  
seventy-four \[different\] times.  
Waited on by celestial nymphs,  
he will enjoy great happiness. (8) \[1246\]

He will reside upon the earth  
\[and\] have three hundred earthly reigns.  
Five hundred times he’s going to be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (9) \[1247\]

He will be a human monarch  
known by the name of Dujjaya.[^4]  
He’ll experience that merit  
without knowing his own karma. (10) \[1248\]

Not going[^5] to a place of grief  
he will go to a human state.  
\[There will\] be heaps of gold \[for him\],  
very much, \[counted in\] billions. (11) \[1249\]

He will be reborn in the world;  
he will \[then\] be a brahmin man,  
beloved own son of Sārī,  
\[and\] the wise son of Vaṅgata. (12) \[1250\]

Then he’ll go forth in the Shiny-  
Bodied[^6] \[Buddha’s\] dispensation.  
His name will be <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>ūla<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>unda,[^7]  
a follower of the Teacher. (13) \[1251\]

\[Even\] when he is a novice,  
he will become an arahant.[^8]  
Knowing well all the defilements  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (14) \[1252\]

To attain the ultimate goal  
I waited on my \[own\] brother,[^9]  
the Great Hero who’d arisen,  
and many pleasant[^10] others, too. (15) \[1253\]

Serving my brother, when he died,  
I put \[his\] relics in \[his\] bowl  
\[and\] gave \[it\] to the Sambuddha,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men. (16) \[1254\]

The Buddha in \[this\] world with gods  
picked up \[that bowl\] with both his hands.  
Paying respect to those relics,  
he praised the top follower \[then\].[^11] (17) \[1255\]

My mind is now completely freed  
and faith is established in me.  
Knowing well all the defilements,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled. (18) \[1256\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (19) \[1257\]

Thus indeed Venerable Cunda Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Cunda Thera is finished.
