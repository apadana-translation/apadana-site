### \[30. Khomadāyaka[^1]\]

In the city Bandhumatī  
I \[lived as\] a trader back then.  
In that way supporting \[my\] wife  
I planted the seeds of \[great\] wealth. (1) \[998\]

I donated one *khoma* cloth  
to the Sage \[known as\] Vipassi,  
Teacher, \[who\] had entered the road,  
in order to obtain merit.[^2] (2) \[999\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave that *khoma* cloth back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that is the fruit of giving cloth. (3) \[1000\]

Seven and twenty aeons ago  
I was Sindhavasandana,[^3]  
possessor of the seven gems,  
\[and\] lord of the four continents. (4) \[1001\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1002\]

Thus indeed Venerable Khomadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Khomadāyaka Thera is finished.
