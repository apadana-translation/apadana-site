### \[140. Piyālaphaladāyaka[^1]\]

I was one who harmed others then,  
a harmer of other beings.[^2]  
I rested on a \[mountain\] slope  
near the Teacher \[known as\] Sikhi. (1) \[1934\]

In the evening and the morning  
I saw the Buddha, the World-Chief.  
\[But\] I had nothing to give to  
the Biped-Lord, the Neutral One. (2) \[1935\]

Taking a *piyāla* fruit, I  
went into the Buddha’s presence.  
The Blessed One accepted \[it\],  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men. (3) \[1936\]

Thenceforth for the sake of others  
I waited on \[Sikhi\], the Guide,[^3]  
\[and\] with that pleasure in \[my\] heart  
I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (4) \[1937\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I gave that fruit \[to the Buddha\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (5) \[1938\]

In the fifteenth aeon ago  
there were three \[men named\] Mālabhi,  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (6) \[1939\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[1940\]

Thus indeed Venerable Piyālaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Piyālaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Piyāla-Fruit-Donor” *Piyāla* (Sinh. *piyal*) is buchanania latifolia. <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> omits “Piyāla,” hence reads the name merely as “Fruit-Donor”. Cf. below, \#497 {500}, for a (different) *apadāna* ascribed to a monk of this name.

[^2]: *pārādhaka*/*parādhaka* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) or *parodhaka* (<abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>, cty) seems to be a neologism. The cty glosses it as *para-satta-rodhaka* (“harmer of other beings”) and as *vihesaka*, “vexer”. The <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss gives “a destroyer of others’ breaths/other beings, a *vädda* (Sri Lankan aborigine, hunter)”. I read *parapāṇu°* (“other beings \[lit., “ones with breath”\],” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) for *paramāṇu* (“atoms,” <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>) in the compound in the second foot.
