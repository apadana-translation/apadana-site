### \[437. {440.}[^1] Jambuphaliya[^2]\]

When Padumuttara Buddha,  
the World’s Best One, the Neutral One,  
was wandering about for alms,  
maintaining superlative fame, (1) \[4710\]

taking the best \[rose-apple\][^3] fruit,  
with a mind that was very clear,  
I gave \[it\] to the Teacher, the  
Hero, the One Deserving Gifts. (2) \[4711\]

O Biped-Lord,[^4] O World’s Best One,  
Bull of Men, due to that karma,  
I’ve attained the unshaking place  
beyond \[all\] conquest and defeat. (3) \[4712\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave that donation then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of giving the best. (4) \[4713\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[4714\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[4715\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4716\]

Thus indeed Venerable Jambuphaliya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Jambuphaliya Thera is finished.

The Summary:

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: “Rose-apple-Fruit-er.” Virtually the same *apadāna* is repeated below as \#{552} (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> only), ascribed to Nadīkassapa Thera. Lacking the name “Rose-apple Fruit-er” there it leaves the type of fruit donated ambiguous, as does the Pāḷi

[^3]: *jambu*. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss suggests this interpolation, presumably based on the name of the protagonist (which appears in the colophon), but the Pāli of the poem itself does not specify what *kind* of fruit this one was the best of.

[^4]: I read this and the following two epithets in the vocative, in keeping with <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>, though <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads them as nominatives, continuing the preceding verse, here and in the repeated version (\#{552}). See the latter for the treatment of them as nominatives.

[^5]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *U[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}chukhaṇḍi*

[^6]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads *Ambāṭakappadā*
