### \[385. {388.}[^1] Panasaphaladāyaka[^2]\]

The Sambuddha named Ajjuna  
dwelt in the Himalayas then.  
He was Endowed with Good Conduct,[^3]  
\[and\] Skillful in Meditation.[^4] (1) \[3320\]

Taking *jīvajīvaka*[^5] jak[^6]  
the size of a jug for water,[^7]  
\[and\] placing it on a leaf-fan,  
I gave \[it\] to the Teacher \[then\]. (2) \[3321\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[Buddha\] that fruit back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[3322\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[3323\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (5) \[3324\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[3325\]

Thus indeed Venerable Panasaphaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Panasaphaladāyaka Thera is finished.

[^2]: “Jak-Fruit Donor.”

[^4]: *samādhikusalo*

[^5]: I follow <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> in treating this as the name of a special type of jak-fruit. It means, “life-lifer,” also (as *jivaṃjīvaka*) the name of a bird (a type of pheasant, according to RD) whose call is similar to the sound “*jīvaṃ jīvaṃ*.”

[^6]: *panasa* (Sinh. *panā*, *kos*) is the jak-fruit tree, Artocarpus integrifolia (*Urti.*)

[^7]: *kumbha-mattaŋ*. *Kumbha* can also mean the frontal globes of an elephant, which are the size of (and resemble) a typical water jug (I’m thinking of a *kalageḍiya* as used in rural Sri Lanka). As will be clear, jak fruit can be very large. It is eaten as a tasty vegetable when young, as a heavy starchy vegetable when mature, and as a sweet fruit when ripe.
