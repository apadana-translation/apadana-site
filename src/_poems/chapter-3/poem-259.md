### \[259. Kuṭidāyaka[^1]\]

At that time the Sambuddha dwelt  
at tree-root, wandering the woods.  
Fashioning a hall of leaves, I  
gave \[it\] for the Unconquered One.[^2] (1) \[2531\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave that hut of leaves \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of hut-donations. (2) \[2532\]

In the thirty-eighth aeon hence  
there were sixteen \[men\] who were kings,  
wheel-turning monarchs who were called,  
quote, Sabbattha-abhivassi.[^3] (3) \[2533\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2534\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kuṭidāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kuṭidāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Hut-Donor”

[^2]: I take *aparājite* as a locative, “with regard to the Unconquered One,” because the opening line concerns a single Sambuddha (who ninety-one aeons ago would have been Vipassi Buddha). But it is possible that the gift was made more generically for “Unconquered Ones,” taking the term as an accusative plural object of *adāsim*

[^3]: “\[Bringer of\] Much Rain Everywhere,” an unusual name which is almost a sentence, perhaps why the text here, equally unusually, includes “iti” after giving the (proper) name, which I have translated, “quote,”.
