### \[227. Vaṭaŋsakiya[^1]\]

I saw the Leader of the World  
being led into a garden.[^2]  
Picking up a wreath for the head  
made of gold, superbly fashioned,  
\[and\] quickly rising up from there,  
mounted on an elephant’s back,  
I gave \[it\] to the Buddha \[then\],  
to Sikhi, Kinsman of the World. (1-2) \[2406-2407\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2408\]

In the twenty-seventh aeon  
hence \[lived\] one lord of the people  
\[who was\] named Mahāpatāpa[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (4) \[2409\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2410\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vaṭaŋsakiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Vaṭaŋsakiya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Chaplet (or Wreath for the Head) \[Donor\].” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gives *sovaṇṇavaṭaŋsakiya*, “Golden Chaplet \[Donor\],” a reading confirmed in the Summary which names this *apadāna* “*Soṇṇa*”. Cf. \#149, above; the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reading allows for the two monks to be distinguished from each other. In this regard cf. also \#228, below.
