### \[446. {449.}[^1] Vedikāraka[^2]\]

Making a well-made railing for  
the foot of the superb Bodhi[^3]  
of Padumuttara Buddha,  
I brought pleasure to \[my\] own heart. (1) \[4777\]

Really excellent[^4] merchandise,[^5]  
\[things\] man-made and \[things\] not man-made,[^6]  
are raining \[on me\] from the sky:  
that is the fruit of a railing. (2) \[4778\]

Being jumped on from both \[sides\] when  
threatening armies are massing,[^7]  
I am not seeing frights or fears:  
that is the fruit of a railing. (3) \[4779\]

Discerning what I am thinking,  
a good mansion gets made[^8] \[for me\]  
\[with\] many very costly beds:  
that is the fruit of a railing. (4) \[4780\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I had that railing made \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of a railing. (5) \[4781\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (6) \[4782\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (7) \[4783\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[4784\]

Thus indeed Venerable Vedikāraka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Vedikāraka Thera is finished.

[^2]: “Railing-Maker.” Cf. \#143, above, for another monk with the same name/seed karma.

[^3]: i.e., at the base of his Bodhi tree, which was a *salala* tree.

[^4]: reading *atolārṇi* (<abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>) or *athoḷārāṇni* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) as *ati-uḷārāṇi*, “excessively lofty” “very superior”

[^6]: *katāni akatāni [c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}a*, or “manufactured and natural”

[^7]: *ubhato byūḷhasaṇgame* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> *vyūḷlhasaṅgame*)/*pakkhadanto bhayānake*, following the first suggestion for interpreting this difficult half-verse in <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss, which takes the first compound as *v\[i\]yūḷha* + *saṅgame*, lit., “the meeting of a mass of troops” (Sinhala gloss: “being sprung upon from two sides by a frightful army”). The other suggestion, also possible, takes *vyūḷlhasaṅgame* in the sense of “meeting that has arisen” (but also “intention,” “plan,” “design:” *aramuṇak*) to produce “\[when\] springing forward into dangerous situations” (or “an intention to spring forward into imminent danger”)

[^8]: lit., “is produced” “is born” “comes into existence”
