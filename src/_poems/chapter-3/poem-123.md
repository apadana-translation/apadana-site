### \[123. Pāyāsadāyaka[^1]\]

\[I saw\] the Golden Sambuddha,  
Bearing the Thirty-two Great Marks  
Honored by the monks’ Assembly,  
who was leaving the forest \[then\]. (1) \[1791\]

Overjoyed I \[then\] arranged for  
milk-rice \[served\] in a bowl of bronze.  
Wishing to offer sacrifice  
I presented \[this\] offering.[^2] (2) \[1792\]

The Buddha[^3] \[living\] at that time,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
had well-ascended[^4] a walkway  
in the wind’s path up in the sky. (3) \[1793\]

And having seen that miracle,  
marvel making hair stand on end,  
placing down that bowl made of bronze,  
I worshipped Vipassi \[right then\]. (4) \[1794\]

“You are the God, Omniscient One,  
over the gods as well as men.  
Having taken pity on me,  
\[please\] accept \[this food,\] O Great Sage.” (5) \[1795\]

Discerning what I was thinking,  
the Teacher, Great Sage in the World,  
the Blessed One, Omniscient One,  
the World-Leader, accepted \[it\]. (6) \[1796\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that alms-food back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of \[some\] milk-rice. (7) \[1797\]

In the forty-first aeon hence  
I was a ruler[^5] named Buddha,[^6]  
a wheel-turner with great power,  
possessor of the seven gems. (8) \[1798\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1799\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pāyāsadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pāyāsadāyaka Thera is finished.
