### \[167. Yūthikapupphiya[^1]\]

On <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andabhāgā River’s bank,  
while traveling along the stream,  
I saw the Self-Become-One there,  
like a regal *sal* tree in bloom. (1) \[2082\]

Carrying a jasmine flower,  
I \[then\] approached the Sage so Great.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I gave the Buddha \[that flower\]. (2) \[2083\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I did that flower-*pūjā* \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2084\]

In the sixty-seventh aeon  
there was one \[named\] Samuddhara,[^2]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2085\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2086\]

Thus indeed Venerable Yūthikapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Yūthikapupphiya Thera is finished.
