## [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itapūjaka[^1] Chapter, the Thirtieth

### \[291. [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itapūjaka[^2]\]

At that time I was a brahmin,  
known by the name of Ajita.[^3]  
Wishing to do a sacrifice,[^4]  
I’d gathered various flowers. (1) \[2671\]

After seeing[^5] the burning pyre,  
of Sikhi, Kinsman of the World,  
gathering those flowers \[again\]  
I strew \[them\] on \[that burning\] pyre. (2) \[2672\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2673\]

In the twenty-seventh aeon  
hence, there were seven lords of men.  
They were named Supajjalita,[^6]  
wheel-turning kings with great strength. (4) \[2674\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2675\]

Thus indeed Venerable [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itapūjaka[^7] Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itapūjaka[^8] Thera is finished.
