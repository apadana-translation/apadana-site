### \[540. {543.}[^1] Sīvali[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the One with Eyes for everything,  
the Leader \[of the World,\] arose  
a hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[6076\]

His morals could not be measured,  
meditative states like lightening,[^3]  
vast[^4] knowledge could not be measured,  
and freedom unlike anything.[^5] (2) \[6077\]

The Leader preached the *Dhamma* to  
the men, the gods,[^6] the snake-gods \[and\]  
the Brahmās \[all\] come together,  
mixed with \[Buddhist\] monks and brahmins. (3) \[6078\]

Confident among Multitudes,[^7]  
the \[Buddha\] placed a merit-filled,  
much-receiving \[and\] gift-worthy  
follower in that foremost place. (4) \[6079\]

I was a kṣatriyan back then,  
in the city named “Haṃsa;”[^8]  
hearing the Victor’s words \[about\]  
the follower’s virtuousness,[^9] (5) \[6080\]

inviting \[Buddha\], for a week  
I fed \[him\] with \[his\] followers.  
Giving a massive alms-giving,  
I aspired \[to attain\] that place. (6) \[6081\]

Then \[he\], the Bull Among People,  
seeing me bowing[^10] at \[his\] feet,  
the Great Hero, in \[his\] good voice,  
uttered these words \[concerning me\]: (7) \[6082\]

Then the multitude, desiring  
to hear the words of the Victor,  
the gods, titans, musical nymphs,  
the greatly powerful Brahmās,[^11]  
and the \[Buddhist\] monks, and brahmins,  
praised \[him\] with hands pressed together:  
“Praise to you, O Well-Bred Person![^12]  
Praise to you, Ultimate Person!  
For a week \[this\] kṣatriyan gave  
a massive alms-giving to you.[^13]  
\[We\] wish to hear the fruit for him;  
prophesy \[that\], O Sage So Great.” (8-10) \[6083-6085\]

After that, the Blessed One said,  
“\[All of\] you listen to my words:  
Who can tell the \[fruit of the\] gift[^14]  
well-established for the Buddha  
\[or\] Assembly, beyond measure?  
It will bear fruit beyond measure.  
This rich man is truly wishing  
\[to attain\] that ultimate place. (11-12) \[6086-6087\]

He’ll be a getter of huge wealth,  
just like the monk Sudassana,[^15]  
\[and\] also just like me \[as well\];  
he’ll receive that in the future. (13) \[6088\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (14) \[6089\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
the one whose name is Sīvali  
will be the Teacher’s follower.” (15) \[6090\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (16) \[6091\]

\[Then\] ninety-one aeons ago,  
the World-Leader \[named\] Vipassi  
arose, the One with Lovely Eyes,[^16]  
with Insight into Everything.[^17] (17) \[6092\]

Then I \[lived\] in Bandhumatī,  
\[a member\] of a certain clan;[^18]  
I was[^19] pitied and sought after,  
one intent on ending karma.[^20] (18) \[6093\]

Then a certain corporation[^21]  
constructed a monastic school[^22]  
for the Great Sage \[named\] Vipassi,  
which was large and widely renowned. (19) \[6094\]

Searching for new curds and honey  
to give along with solid food[^23]  
at the end of the great alms-gift,  
they did not find[^24] \[any to give\]. (20) \[6095\]

Then having taken \[some\] of that,[^25]  
new curds and also honey too,  
I went to the overseer’s house,[^26]  
and seeking that they saw me.[^27] (21) \[6096\]

Even offering a thousand,  
they did not obtain those two \[things\].[^28]  
I thought \[about it\] then like this:  
“That \[price\] would not be too little.  
As far as all these people are  
honoring \[him\], the Thus-Gone-One,  
I too will do a \[pious\] deed,  
for the World-Lord with Assembly.” (22-23) \[6097-6098\]

Then having thought \[it out\] like that,  
mixing together the curds and  
the honey, I gave \[them\] to the  
Lord of the World with Assembly. (24) \[6099\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (25) \[6100\]

Again, in Benares, being  
a king \[who was\] very famous,  
enraged[^29] at an enemy \[then,\]  
I caused the gateway to be blocked. (26) \[6101\]

Then, obstructing ascetics[^30] \[too\],  
\[it\] was guarded thus for a week.[^31]  
Therefore, as the result of that  
karma, I fell hard into hell.[^32] (27) \[6102\]

And now in \[my\] final rebirth,  
due to the kṣatriyan’s good deeds,[^33]  
I’m born in Koliya city;  
my mother was Suppavāsā,[^34]  
father Mahāli Li[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}chavi.[^35]  
Because of obstructing the gate,  
I gestated for seven years,  
suffering in \[my\] mother’s womb. (28-29) \[6103-6104\]

One week breached in the birth canal,[^36]  
I’m endowed with great suffering.  
Because she gave approval \[then\],  
my mother suffered greatly \[now\].[^37] (30) \[6105\]

Departing from Śrāvasti, I  
was pitied by \[him\], the Buddha;  
on the very day I set out,  
I went forth into homelessness. (31) \[6106\]

My preceptor: Sāriputta;  
powerful[^38] Moggallāna, the  
wise, instructed me \[as teacher\]  
\[while he was\] removing my hair. (32) \[6107\]

While my hair was being cut off,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.  
Gods, snake-gods and human beings  
are bringing me the requisites.[^39] (33) \[6108\]

Because, delighted, I worshipped[^40]  
\[Buddha\] named Padumuttara  
and the Guide, Vipassi \[Buddha\],  
I’m distinguished with requisites. (34) \[6109\]

Due to the distinction of those  
deeds, I’m receiving everywhere  
enormous \[and\] ultimate wealth,  
in woods, village, water \[and\] land. (35) \[6110\]

When the Guide is traveling for  
the sake of seeing Revata,  
the World’s Chief Leader together  
with thirty times a thousand monks,  
the Great Wise One,[^41] the Great Hero,  
the World’s Chief Leader with the monks,[^42]  
the Buddha’s then served by me with  
requisites the gods bring for me;  
having gone he saw[^43] Revata,  
then going to Jetavana,  
\[he\] placed me in that foremost place. (36-38) \[6111-6113\]

The Teacher, Friend of Every World,[^44]  
praised me amidst the multitude:  
“O monks, Sīvali’s the foremost  
receiver among my students.” (39) \[6114\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (40) \[6115\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (41) \[6116\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (42) \[6117\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sīvali Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sīvali Thera is finished.
