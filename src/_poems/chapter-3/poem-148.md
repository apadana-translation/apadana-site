### \[148. Phalakadāyaka[^1]\]

A carriage-maker in the city,  
I was skilled in working with wood.  
Having made a sandalwood plank  
I gave it to the World’s Kinsman. (1) \[1977\]

Made of gold, this divine mansion  
lights up \[all of the directions\].  
Elephant, divine and equine  
carriages are provided \[me\]. (2) \[1978\]

Palaces and palanquins too  
are produced according to wish;  
unsifted,[^2] gemstones come to me:  
that is the fruit of a plank-\[gift\]. (3) \[1979\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that plank-\[gift back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of a plank-\[gift\]. (4) \[1980\]

In the fifty-seventh aeon,  
four \[men named\] Bhavanimmita[^3]  
were wheel-turning kings with great strength,  
possessors of the seven gems. (5) \[1981\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1982\]

Thus indeed Venerable Phalakadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Phalakadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Slab-Donor”

[^2]: lit., “unshaken”. I take this to mean that when he picks up a handful of gravel, it’s all gems. Ordinarily, gemmers must sift through vast amounts of sand and worthless stone to locate gems.

[^3]: “Existence-Constructors” or “Rebirth-Constructors”
