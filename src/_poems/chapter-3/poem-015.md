### \[15. Pilindava[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}cha[^1]\]

When the World-Leader Sumedha,  
the Best Person, reached nirvana,  
with a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind  
I did *pūjā* to \[his\] stupa. (1) \[728\]

Gathering together there those  
whose defilements had been destroyed,  
special knowledges, superpowers,  
I gave the monks’ Assembly a meal. (2) \[729\]

At that time I \[also\] waited  
on Sumedha the Blessed One.  
He who was known as Sumedha  
then provided his thanks \[to me\]. (3) \[730\]

Due to the pleasure in \[my\] heart  
I‘m born in a \[divine\] mansion.  
Eight-six thousand divine nymphs[^2]  
delighted me \[in that mansion\]. (4) \[731\]

They submitted only to me,  
with every pleasure constantly.  
I surpassed \[all\] the other gods;  
that is the fruit of good karma. (5) \[732\]

In the twenty-fifth aeon \[thence\]  
I was the king[^3] named Varuṇa.  
I was then a wheel-turning king  
endowed with extra special food. (6) \[733\]

They did not have to plant the seed  
nor did they need to yoke the plough;  
\[all\] the folks \[were able\] to feed  
on rice uncooked with firewood. (7) \[734\]

After reigning there \[in that way\]  
I went back[^4] to the divine state.  
Then too in that same way for me  
success in food came into being. (8) \[735\]

No living being, friend or foe  
is doing any harm to me.  
I am beloved of them all;  
that is the fruit of good karma. (9) \[736\]

In the thirty thousand aeons  
since I provided that gift then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that’s the fruit of scented ointment.[^5] (10) \[737\]

In this \[present\] lucky aeon  
one time I was the lord of men.  
I was a wheel-turning king \[then\]  
of great majesty and power. (11) \[738\]

I established many people  
in the five moral precepts \[then\]  
\[and\] made them achieve good rebirths;  
I was beloved of the gods. (12) \[739\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (13) \[740\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pilindava[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}cha Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pilindava[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}cha Thera is finished.

[^1]: <dfn id="#BJTS"><abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr></dfn> gives Pilindiva[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}cha, which is also an alt reading in cty. As DPPN notes this may be a monk different from the famous Pilindava[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}cha of whom a much longer *apadāna* appears as \#388 {391}, below.

[^2]: i.e., *apsaras*

[^3]: lit., “kṣatriyan”.

[^4]: lit., “again”.

[^5]: presumably his foundational *pūjā* entailed rubbing scented ointment upon the stupa of Sumedha Buddha.
