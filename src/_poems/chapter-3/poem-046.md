### \[46. Paduma[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}chadaniya[^1]\]

When Vipassi, the Chief Person,  
the World-Lord had reached nirvana,  
taking a pink lotus in bloom  
I placed it on \[the Buddha’s\] pyre. (1) \[1197\]

And when \[it\] was placed on the pyre,  
\[that lotus\] rose[^2] into the sky.  
Making an awning in the sky  
I held \[it there\][^3] over the pyre. (2) \[1198\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I offered that flower \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[1199\]

Forty-seven aeons ago  
\[I was\] named Padumissara,[^4]  
victorious on \[all\] four sides,  
a wheel-turner with great power. (4) \[1200\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1201\]

Thus indeed, Venerable Padumu[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}chadaniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Padumu[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}chadaniya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Pink-Lotus-Cover-er”

[^2]: reading *uggamī* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> (and <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> alt.) for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *uggamiŋ* (“I rose”)

[^3]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> agrees in reading the verb in the first person, though <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> alt. gives a reading in third person, which would be better here

[^4]: “Lord of Lotuses”
