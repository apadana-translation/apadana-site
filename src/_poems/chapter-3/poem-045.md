### \[45. Pañ[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}ahatthiya[^1]\]

The Sambuddha named Sumedha  
was traveling through the bazaar  
with downcast eyes,[^2] \[speaking\] few words,  
mindful, with his sense\[-doors\] guarded. (1) \[1191\]

Then they brought[^3] \[me\] — for my top-crest[^4] —  
five handfuls of water lilies.  
I did Buddha-*pūjā* with them  
\[feeling well-\] pleased by \[my\] own hands. (2) \[1192\]

\[Then\] those flowers \[that I had\] placed  
became the Teacher’s canopy.  
They flocked to[^5] the Great Elephant  
like students to a \[good\] teacher. (3) \[1193\]

In the thirty thousand aeons  
since I offered \[him\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (4) \[1194\]

One hundred twenty aeons hence  
there were five \[different\] kṣatriyans.  
\[All of them\] were named Hatthiya,[^6]  
wheel-turning kings with great power. (5) \[1195\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1196\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pañ[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}ahatthiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pañ[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}ahatthiya Thera is finished.
