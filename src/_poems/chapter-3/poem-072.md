### \[72. Padasaññaka[^1]\]

As it stepped[^2] I saw the foot of  
Tissa, the Kinsman of the Sun.[^3]  
Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I pleased my heart over that foot. (1) \[1427\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I obtained that perception \[then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of foot-perception. (2) \[1428\]

In the seventh aeon \[ago\]  
the Kṣatriyan named Sumedha  
was a wheel-turner with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (3) \[1429\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[1430\]

Thus indeed Venerable Padasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Padasaññaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Foot-Perceiver”

[^2]: the term here is *akkantam*, which means “stepped upon” or “defeated,” but avoiding the implication that someone stepped on the Buddha’s foot, the cty explains that it was “stepping upon” (*akkamamānaṃ*) and makes the point of the *pāda* simply that he saw the “foot-shrine” (*pada[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}etiyaṃ*) of the Buddha.

[^3]: *ādi[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}abandhuno*
