### \[35. Mogharāja\]

The Blessed One Atthadassi  
the Self-Become One, Unconquered,  
encompassed by the monks’ Assembly  
entered the chariot-road \[then\]. (1) \[1066\]

With my students \[all\] around me  
I \[then\] departed from the house.  
Having gone out I \[then\] saw there  
\[the Sambuddha\], the World-Leader. (2) \[1067\]

\[Then\] saluting the Sambuddha,  
hands pressed together on my head,  
bringing pleasure to \[my\] own heart,  
I praised the World-Leader kindly: (3) \[1068\]

To what extent beings have form,  
are formless or are unconscious,  
all of them are included in  
the \[great\] knowledge that you possess.[^1] (4) \[1069\]

If one encloses water with  
a net that is good for fishing,  
all the creatures in the water  
would \[then\] be caught inside the net. (5) \[1070\]

And whoever has intentions  
one with form or a formless one,  
are all of them included in  
the \[great\] knowledge that you possess. (6) \[1071\]

You’re lifting up this world which is  
confused by the darkness-maker.[^2]  
Having listened to your Teaching  
they \[all then\] cross the flood of doubt. (7) \[1072\]

This world’s enmeshed in ignorance,  
covered by the darkness-maker.  
In your knowledge they shine brightly  
driving out the darkness-maker. (8) \[1073\]

That eye of yours, for everyone,  
is what removes the great darkness.  
Having listened to your Teaching  
many folks achieve nirvana.” (9) \[1074\]

Having filled up a container  
\[with\] a bit of pure \[bee’s\] honey,  
picking it up with both \[my\] hands,  
I held it out to the Great Sage. (10) \[1075\]

The Great Hero, the Sage So Great,  
accepted it, with \[some\] boiled rice.[^3]  
Eating it, the Omniscient One  
then rose up into the sky[^4] \[there\]. (11) \[1076\]

Teacher Atthadassi, Man-Bull,  
standing up in the atmosphere,  
bringing pleasure to my \[own\] heart,  
\[then\] spoke these verses \[about me\]: (12) \[1077\]

“This one by whom knowledge is praised  
and the Best Buddha is lauded,  
due to the pleasure in \[his\] heart,  
will not go to a bad rebirth. (13) \[1078\]

He will exercise divine rule  
\[fully\] fourteen \[different\] times \[then\].  
He will reside upon the earth  
with eight hundred earthly[^5] reigns \[there\]. (14) \[1079\]

And five hundred times he will be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\].  
He will exercise on the earth  
uncountable regional reigns. (15) \[1080\]

A learned man who knows mantras,  
he will master the three Vedas.  
And \[then\] he will renounce the world  
in Gotama Buddha’s teaching.[^6] (16) \[1081\]

Through \[his\] knowledge he’ll discover  
facts which are \[so\] deep and subtle.  
He’ll be the Teacher’s follower  
\[whose\] name \[will be\] Mogharāja, (17) \[1082\]

endowed with the three knowledges,[^7]  
undefiled, a duty-doer.  
Gotama the Top Charioteer  
will place him in that foremost place.” (18) \[1083\]

Abandoning \[my\] human work,  
severing the bonds of being,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
without defilements I \[now\] live. (19) \[1084\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (20) \[1085\]

Thus indeed Venerable Mogharāja Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Mogharāja Thera is finished.

[^1]: reading *samogadhā* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) for *samāhaṭā* (<abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>). The Sinhala gloss in <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> understands the verse to refer to the beings in Brahmaloka; though the text does not stipulate that, it would make sense of the inclusion here of formless and non-sentient beings (as are found there, along with beings that have form). In any event, the point of the verse is that the Buddha’s knowledge is all-encompassing.

[^2]: lit., “that which causes darkness” = ignorance, delusion

[^3]: reading *sabhattena* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) for *subhakena* (<abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>)

[^4]: lit., “rose up into the sky the sky;” I have reduced the redundancy of *vehāsaṃ nabhaṃ*, as does the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss.

[^5]: I read *pathavyā* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) for *padesa* (<abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>), to avoid the redundancy (even contradiction) with the next verse.

[^6]: lit., “in the dispensation of Gotama, the Blessed One”

[^7]: *tīhi vijjāhi*
