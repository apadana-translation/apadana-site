### \[313. Gatasaññaka[^1]\]

There are no footprints in the air;  
the sky is not marked by the wind.  
I saw the Victor, Siddhattha  
journeying to the world of gods.[^2] (1) \[2777\]

I saw the Sammāsambuddha’s  
robe being shaken by the wind.  
Having seen the Sage’s journey,  
joy is born for all time for me. (2) \[2778\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I obtained that perception then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of Buddha-perception. (3) \[2779\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2780\]

Thus indeed Venerable Gatasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Gatasaññaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “Perceived \[Buddha\] Gone”
