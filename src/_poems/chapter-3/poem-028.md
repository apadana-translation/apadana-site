### \[28. Uttiya\]

On [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}andabhāgā River’s bank  
I was a crocodile back then.  
Being engaged in getting food  
I went up to the river bank. (1) \[983\]

At that time the Self-Become One,  
Siddhattha, the Best among Men,  
approached a ford on that river  
wishing to cross the river \[there\]. (2) \[984\]

When the Sambuddha had arrived  
I also approached that \[same\] place.  
Having approached I \[then\] uttered  
these \[kind\] words to the Sambuddha: (3) \[985\]

“Climb aboard \[me\], O Great Hero,  
I’ll take you across the river.  
This is the sphere of my fathers;  
please have pity, O Sage So Great.” (4) \[986\]

Having heard me growling loudly  
the Great Sage \[then\] climbed up \[on me\].  
Smiling with a heart of laughter  
I ferried the World-Chief across. (5) \[987\]

\[Then\] that World-Chief \[named\] Siddhattha  
\[gone to\] the other river bank  
gave consolation to me there:  
“you will achieve the deathless \[state\].” (6) \[988\]

After falling from that body  
I went on to the world of gods.  
Surrounded by celestial nymphs  
I enjoyed \[much\] divine pleasure. (6) \[989\]

Seven times as the king of gods  
I exercised divine rule \[there\].  
Three times as a wheel-turning king  
I was the lord of the \[whole\] earth. (7) \[990\]

Binding \[myself\] to solitude,  
I am clever and self-controlled.  
I’m \[now\] bearing \[my\] last body,  
in the Sambuddha’s \[great\] teaching. (8) \[991\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I \[thus\] ferried the Bull of Men  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth;  
that is the fruit of ferrying. \[992\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[993\]

Thus indeed Venerable Uttiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Uttiya Thera is finished.
