## Ka[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}āna Chapter, the Fifty-Fourth

### \[528. {531.}[^1] Mahāka[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}āna[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
Lust-less,[^3] Unconquered Vanquisher,[^4]  
the Leader came into being,  
one hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[5663\]

The Hero, with Lotus-Leaf Eyes,[^5]  
with a Mouth as Pure as the Moon,[^6]  
Shining like a Mountain of Gold,[^7]  
Bright as the Sun when it’s Blazing,[^8] (2) \[5664\]

Transporting Beings’ Eyes \[and\] Minds,[^9]  
Adorned with the Excellent Marks,[^10]  
Traveled the Roads of All Sayings,[^11]  
Honored by People and the Gods,[^12] (3) \[5665\]

Sambuddha, waking beings up,[^13]  
Eloquent One,[^14] Sweet-Sounding One,[^15]  
Compassion’s Continuous Nest,[^16]  
Confident among Multitudes,  
is preaching the sweet Teaching \[there\],  
taking up the Four Noble Truths.[^17]  
He is lifting up those with breath,  
when they’re sunk in delusion’s muck. (4-5) \[5666-5667\]

Being an ascetic, alone,  
\[my\] home was Himalaya then.  
I saw the Victor, traveling[^18]  
the world of humans through the sky. (6) \[5668\]

Having gone into his presence,  
I \[then\] heard \[him\] preaching *Dhamma*  
\[and\] praising the great virtue of  
one of that Hero’s followers: (7) \[5669\]

“Whereby[^19] this \[monk\] Ka[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}āyana[^20]  
provides lengthy[^21] explanations  
of what’s been said by me[^22] in brief,  
he gladdens multitudes, and me.  
I see no other follower  
\[or\] anyone \[preaching\] this way.  
Thus he’s top, in that foremost place;[^23]  
so should you consider[^24] \[him\], monks.” (8-9) \[5670-5671\]

At that time, being astonished,  
having heard that lovely speaking,  
going to the Himalayas,  
bringing back a heap of flowers,  
having worshipped[^25] the World’s-Refuge,[^26]  
I aspired \[to attain\] that place.  
At that time, discerning my wish,  
the Refuge-less One[^27] prophesied: (10-11) \[5672-5673\]

“All of you, look at this great sage,[^28]  
skin the color of polished gold,  
hair growing upward, broad-shouldered,[^29]  
standing steadfast,[^30] hands together,[^31]  
with eyes which are full of laughter,  
at home in praising the Buddha,[^32]  
grasping the Teaching superbly,[^33]  
resembling sprinkled ambrosia.[^34] (12-13) \[5673-5674\][^35]

Hearing \[of\] Ka[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}āna’s virtue,  
he stands \[there\] wishing for that place.  
When very far in the future,  
the Sage So Great is Gotama,  
Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
\[this one\] will be that Teacher’s follower;  
his name will be Ka[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}āna \[then\]. (14-15) \[5675-5676\]

Very learned, with great knowledge,  
clever at conclusions,[^36] a sage,  
he will attain that \[wished-for\] place,  
as this has been foretold[^37] by me.” (16) \[5677\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I did that karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (17) \[5678\]

I transmigrate in \[just\] two states:  
that of a god, or of a man.  
I don’t go to other rebirths:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (18) \[5679\]

\[When human\] I‘m born in two clans:  
the kṣatriyan or the brahmin.  
I don’t get born in lesser clans:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (19) \[5680\]

Now, in \[my\] final existence,  
I was born in Ujjain city,[^38]  
sharp, a master of the Vedas,  
the son of Tiriṭiva[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}cha,[^39]  
who was the brahmin counsellor[^40]  
of the \[king\], Pajjota [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}aṇḍa;[^41]  [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[C]{.diacritics data-state=on}
my mother’s <span class="diacritics" data-state="on">C</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">Ch</span>andapaduma;[^42]  
\[I’m\] Ka<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">cc</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">chch</span>āna, with superb skin. (20-21) \[5681-5682\]

Dispatched by the earth’s protector[^43]  
to \[go and\] invite the Buddha,  
having seen the Heap of Virtue,  
Leader, Door to Freedom City,[^44]  
and having heard his flawless speech  
which cleanses the muck of rebirth,  
I attained deathless peacefulness,  
with five hundred \[associates\]. (22-23) \[5683-5684\]

Clever at conclusions by birth,  
very wealthy and good-looking,  
I was placed in that foremost place  
of the Well-Gone-One, the Wise One.[^45] (24) \[5685\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (25) \[5686\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (26) \[5687\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (27) \[5688\]

Thus indeed Venerable Mahāka[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}āna Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Mahāka[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}āna Thera is finished.
