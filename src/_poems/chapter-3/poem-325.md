### \[325. Nimittasaññaka[^1]\]

On [C]{.diacritics data-state=on}[Ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}andabhāgā River’s bank,  
I dwelt in a hermitage \[then\].  
I saw a golden-colored deer,  
\[which\] was wandering through the woods. (1) \[2852\]

Having pleased \[my\] heart in \[that\] deer,  
I recalled the World’s Best \[Buddha\].  
With that \[same\] pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I recalled the other Buddhas: (2) \[2853\]

“Those Buddhas who have passed away,  
Thus-Gone-Ones, \[while they\] were living,  
in this very same way shined forth,  
like \[golden\] deer-kings for the heart.” (3) \[2854\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I obtained that perception then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of perceiving Buddhas. (4) \[2855\]

In the twenty-seventh aeon  
hence there was one lord of the earth,  
\[who\] was named Araññasatta,[^2]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (5) \[2856\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[2857\]

Thus indeed Venerable Nimittasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Nimittasaññaka Thera is finished.
