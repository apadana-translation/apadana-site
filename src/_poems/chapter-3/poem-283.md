### \[283. Pa[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}uggamaniya[^1]\]

With a mind that was very clear,  
I went out and gave greetings to  
Siddhattha \[Buddha\], World’s Torch,[^2]  
the Physician for Every World,[^3]  
the Bull of Men, who had arrived  
like a lion in the forest,[^4]  
like a bull of the finest breed,  
splendid like an arjuna tree.[^5] (1-2) \[2633-2634\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I went to meet the Bull of Men,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of going to meet. (3) \[2635\]

In the twenty-seventh aeon  
hence there was one ruler of men,  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
who was named Suparivāra.[^6] (4) \[2636\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2637\]

Thus indeed Venerable Pa[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}uggamaniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Pa[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}uggamaniya Thera is finished.
