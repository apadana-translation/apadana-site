### \[260. Aggapupphiya[^1]\]

To give an *aggaja*[^2] blossom,  
I approached the Ultimate Man,  
the Golden-Colored Sambuddha,  
Sikhi, \[who\] like a heap of fire[^3]  
was shining forth \[his thousand\] rays  
while sitting on a mountainside.  
Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
I offered Buddha \[that flower\]. (1-2) \[2535-2536\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2537\]

In the twenty-fifth aeon \[hence\]  
I‘m known \[by the name\] Amita,[^4]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2538\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2539\]

Thus indeed Venerable Aggapupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Aggapupphiya Thera is finished.

The Thomaka Chapter, the Twenty-Sixth

[^1]: “*Agga*-Flower-er”. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> takes *agga* (“first” or “chief”) or *aggaja* (“first born” or “eldest brother”) as the name of a flower, which is reasonable given the context of its usage here, and is also the conclusion of the cty: “*Aggajaṃ puppham ādāya ti aggaja-nāmakaṃ pupphaṃ*…”

[^2]: one is tempted to take the literal meaning (“first born” etc.) as a proper name of the flower and translate accordingly, but I have not found the term in dictionaries so that would imply too much certainly about it. The <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> ed. gives the name of the monk as Aggapupphiya, and it is thus unclear whether *agga* or *aggaja* would be the flower's name. It is also possible, contra the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>, to see this not as the *name* of the flower but rather some characteristic of it, e.g., “first blossom” on a plant, or “produced (*jan*) through some chief/top/best method (*agga*).

[^3]: *sikhī*, a play on the meaning of the Buddha’s name. It can also mean “peacock.”

[^4]: “Boundless”

[^5]: omitting *[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}a* following <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> alternative as well as <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>. This keeps the meter right, in Pāli as much as in English. There are anyway already two *[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}as* in the following line, which keeps the English awkward enough.
