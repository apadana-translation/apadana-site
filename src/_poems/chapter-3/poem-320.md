### \[320. Kumudamāliya[^1]\]

Taking a white lotus bloom I  
laid it \[before\] the Best Buddha,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the Bull, Excellent One, Hero,  
Victorious One, the Great Sage,  
Vipassi \[Buddha\], Great Hero,  
like a lion which is well-born. (1-2) \[2821-2822\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I did *pūjā* \[with\] that flower,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2823\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2824\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kumudamāliya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kumudamāliya Thera is finished.
