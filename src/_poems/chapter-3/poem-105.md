### \[105. Muṭṭhipupphiya[^1]\]

I was a garland-maker then  
who was known as Sudassana.[^2]  
I saw the Buddha, Stainless One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men. (1) \[1634\]

Picking up a jasmine flower,  
happy and with \[my\] eyes most clear  
I worshipped Padumuttara,  
the Divine-Eyed-One who had come. (2) \[1635\]

Because of that Buddha-*pūjā*  
and the resolve in \[my own\] heart,  
for one hundred thousand aeons  
I came into no bad rebirth. (3) \[1636\]

There were sixteen \[different\] kings \[then,\]  
\[all were\] known as Devuttara,[^3]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength,  
in the thirty-sixth aeon hence. (4) \[1637\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1638\]

Thus indeed Venerable Muṭṭhipupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Muṭṭhipupphiya Thera is finished.
