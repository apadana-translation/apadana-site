### \[138. Ekapasādaniya[^1]\]

\[Although\] my name was “Nārada,”  
I was known \[then\] as “Kesava,”[^2]  
seeking after both good and bad,[^3]  
I came into Buddha’s presence. (1) \[1923\]

Loving-Hearted, Compassionate,  
Atthadassi, the Sage so Great,  
consoling \[all the world’s\] beings,  
the Eyeful One preached \[his\] *Dhamma*. (2) \[1924\]

Having brought \[my\] own heart pleasure,  
pressing both my hands on my head,  
after \[I’d\] worshipped the Teacher,  
I departed facing the east. (3) \[1925\]

In the seventeen-hundredth aeon  
I was king, ruler of the earth,  
known as Amittavāsana,[^4]  
a wheel-turner with great power. (4) \[1926\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1927\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekapasādaniya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekapasādaniya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “One-Pleasing”. This is the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reading. <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reads the name as Ekadaŋsaniya; cty reads Ekapadāsaniya. The chapter summary below leads one to expect here an *Ekadussī-apadāna*, witnessed in none of the mss. which nevertheless maintain the chapter summary. There is a parallel case in the chapter summary for Chapter 33, below, which calls for an *Ekadussika-apadāna* absent in <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>; there, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> supplies one (as \#{334}, *Ekadussadāyaka-apadāna*, see below)

[^2]: “Maned-One” “Lion”

[^3]: lit., “seeking after wholesome and unwholesome”

[^4]: “Dwelling Without Friends” (or “Not Living Off Friends”?)
