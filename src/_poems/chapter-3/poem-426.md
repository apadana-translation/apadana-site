### \[423. {426.}[^1] Ghatamaṇḍadāyaka[^2]\]

Seeing the Blessed One, Well-Thought,[^3]  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
entered into the great forest,  
tormented by internal pain,[^4]  
bringing pleasure to \[my own\] heart,  
I presented cream from some ghee.[^5] (1) \[4539\][^6]

From doing and heaping \[that\] up,[^7]  
the river \[named\] Bhāgīrathī,[^8]  
\[and\] even the four great oceans  
are supplying \[ghee-\]cream to me. (2) \[4540\]

And even this \[whole\] awful earth,  
beyond measure, beyond counting,  
discerning what I am thinking,  
turns into honey and sugar.[^9] (3) \[4541\]

These trees on \[all\] four continents,  
foot-drinkers growing in the earth,[^10]  
discerning what I am thinking,  
turn into[^11] wishing-trees \[for me\]. (4) \[4542\]

Fifty times the lord of the gods,  
I exercised divine rule \[there\].  
And fifty-one times I was \[then\]  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\].  
\[And I enjoyed\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (5) \[4543\][^12]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[him\] that gift at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of the cream from ghee. (6) \[4544\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (7) \[4545\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[4546\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[4547\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ghatamaṇḍadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ghatamaṇḍadāyaka Thera is finished.

[^2]: “Cream-of-Ghee Donor.” This *apadāna* is repeated verbatim below, with the same name, as \#493 {496}.

[^3]: *su[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}intitaŋ*

[^4]: *vātābādhena*, “a disease of the wind,” one of the three humors in classical Indian (including Buddhist) medical traditions.

[^5]: *ghata* (cream, scum) + *maṇḍa* (clarified butter, ghee), i.e., the best part of the ghee, the purest oil skimmed off the top of a pot of ghee.

[^10]: this foot (as elsewhere) consists of two different words for” tree”: *dharaṇī-rūha* (“growing in the earth”) and *pādapa* (“drinking from the feet \[or roots\]”). Though awkward in English, I translate literally here rather than give the non-descriptive “tree, which was a tree”.
