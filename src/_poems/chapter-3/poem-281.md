## Paṇṇadāyaka Chapter, the Twenty-Ninth

### \[281. Paṇṇadāyaka[^1]\]

Sitting in a room made of leaves,  
I am feeding on leaves as food.  
Siddhattha \[Buddha\], the World’s Torch,[^2]  
the Physician for Every World,[^3]  
the Greatest Sage \[then\] did approach  
me seated \[in that room of leaves\].  
I gave leaves to him \[when he was\]  
sitting on a mat made of leaves. (1-2) \[2623-2624\]

In the ninety-four aeons since  
I gave \[those\] leaves \[to him\] back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving leaves. (3) \[2625\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2626\]

Thus indeed Venerable Paṇṇadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Paṇṇadāyaka Thera is finished.
