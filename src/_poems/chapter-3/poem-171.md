## Kumuda Chapter, the Eighteenth

### \[171. Kumudamāliya[^1]\]

In the Himalayan Mountains,  
there was a large, natural lake.  
I was a *rakkhasa* born there,  
of frightful form, having great strength. (1) \[2104\]

White lotuses were blooming there,  
arising just as big as wheels,[^2]  
and I \[then\] picked those[^3] lotuses.  
The Strong One’s[^4] group[^5] was \[there\] then \[too\]. (2) \[2105\]

But Atthadassi, Blessed One,  
the Biped-Lord, the Bull of Men,  
seeing that those flowers were picked,[^6]  
did come into my presence \[then\]. (3) \[2106\]

The God of Gods, the Bull of Men,  
the Sambuddha approached \[me then\].  
Picking up all of those flowers  
I gave \[them all\] to the Buddha. (4) \[2107\]

That company then \[stretched\] out to  
the ends of the Himalayas.[^7]  
With a canopy \[over\] him[^8]  
the Thus-Gone-One did journey forth. (5) \[2108\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I offered \[that\] flower \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (6) \[2109\]

In the fifteenth aeon ago,  
there were seven lords of people,  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
\[all\] known as Sahassaratha.[^9] (7) \[2110\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (8) \[2111\]

Thus indeed Venerable Kumudamāliya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Kumudamāliya Thera is finished.

[^1]: “White-Lotus-Garland-er”

[^2]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss takes this measure to be that of a chariot wheel (*riya-sak*), in which case they were very large lotuses indeed.

[^3]: reading *taṃ* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) for *ahaŋ* (“I,” <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>).

[^4]: I follow <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> in reading *balino* for *phalino* (“of the one bearing fruit,” <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>), though neither *balī* nor *phalī* is one of the regular Buddha-epithets in *Apadāna*, so the choice is somewhat arbitrary: the Buddha might as well be “the Fruitful One” as “the Strong One”.

[^5]: *Samiti*, which <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss takes to mean the Assembly of monks, i.e., the Buddha and his monastic followers

[^6]: reading *samo[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itaṃ* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) for *saṅko[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}itaŋ* (<abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>).

[^7]: reading *yāvatā himavantantā parisā sā tadā ahu* (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr>) for *yāvatā himavantato yāva samantato ahu* (“as far as the ends of the Himalayas, on all sides there was,” <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>)

[^8]: reading *tā[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}chadanasampanno* ("endowed with a canopy \[on top of\] him”) with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *agga[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}chadanasampanno* (“with a canopy on top \[on top of him\]”)
