## Yasa Chapter, the Fifty-Sixth[^1]

### \[{551.}[^2] Yasa[^3]\]

Floating in[^4] the great ocean, my  
palace \[then\] was very well-made.  
There was a pond, \[also\] well made,  
\[full of\] the cries of ruddy geese,[^5] \[6331\]

covered with *mandālaka*[^6] blooms  
and with pink and blue lotuses.  
And a river was flowing there,  
beautiful, with excellent banks, \[6332\]

covered with fish and tortoises,[^7]  
with various birds spread about,[^8]  
noisy with peacocks[^9] \[and\] herons,[^10]  
\[and\] the \[calls of birds\] like cuckoos.[^11] \[6333\]

Pigeons[^12] \[and\] *ravi*-swans[^13] \[as well\],  
ruddy geese[^14] and *nadī[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}aras*,  
lapwings[^15] \[and\] mynah birds[^16] are here,  
small monkeys,[^17] *jīvajīvakas*.[^18] \[6334\]

\[It\] resounds with swans and herons,  
owls and many *piṅgalas*.  
The sand contains the seven gems,  
\[strewn with\] jewels \[and costly\] pearls. \[6335\]

All of the trees, made out[^19] of gold,  
pervaded by various scents,  
are lighting up my palace \[there\],  
by day and night, all of the time. \[6336\]

Sixty thousand instruments are  
being played morning and evening.  
Sixteen thousand women \[as well\]  
are waiting on me constantly. \[6337\]

Happy, with pleasure in \[my\] heart,  
having departed \[my\] palace,  
I worshipped that Greatly Famed One,  
Sumedha, Leader of the World. \[6338\]

Having greeted the Sambuddha,  
inviting him \[and\] Assembly,  
that Wise One then agreed \[to come\],  
Sumedha, Leader of the World. \[6339\]

Having preached the *Dhamma* to me,[^20]  
the Great Sage \[later\] took his leave.  
Having greeted the Sambuddha,  
I returned to my palace \[then\]. \[6340\]

I summoned \[all\] the people[^21] there:  
“All of you gather together.  
In the first part of the day,  
the Buddha will come to the palace.” \[6341\]

“We dwelling near you have received  
something that’s well-gotten for us.  
We too will do a *pūjā* for  
the Teacher, the Best of Buddhas.” \[6342\]

After putting up food \[and\] drink,  
I announced that it was the time.  
The Leader of the World arrived  
with one hundred thousand masters.[^22] \[6343\]

I went to meet \[him\] with the five  
musical instruments \[sounding\].  
The Supreme Person[^23] sat down on  
a chair made out of solid gold. \[6344\]

I placed[^24] a canopy above,  
which was made out of solid gold;  
fans are then diffusing \[perfumes\]  
within the Assembly of monks. \[6345\]

I regaled the monks’ Assembly  
with large amounts of food \[and\] drink;  
I gave individual pairs  
of cloth[^25] to the monks’ Assembly. \[6346\]

The one whom they called Sumedha,  
Sacrificial Recipient,[^26]  
sitting in the monks’ Assembly,  
spoke these \[six\] verses \[at that time\]: \[6347\]

“This one who \[gave\] me food and drink  
and fed[^27] all of these \[monks\] with it,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: \[6348\]

For eighteen hundred aeons he  
will delight in the world of gods.  
A thousand times he’ll be a king,  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. \[6349\]

In whichever womb he’s reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
a canopy of solid gold  
will always[^28] be carried \[for him\]. \[6350\]

In thirty thousand aeons \[hence\],  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. \[6351\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements,  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled. \[6352\]

Sitting in the monks’ Assembly  
he will \[then\] roar the lion’s roar.[^29]  
On \[his\] pyre an umbrella’s borne;[^30]  
beneath it[^31] he is cremated.” \[6353\]

Monkhood has been attained by me;  
my defilements are \[now\] burnt up.  
In a pavilion or tree-root,  
burning heat is not known by me. \[6354\]

In the thirty thousand aeons  
since I gave that gift at that time,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of giving everything. \[6355\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. \[6356\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6357\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! \[6358\]

Thus indeed Venerable Yasa Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Yasa Thera, the first.

[^1]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> ends with its \#547 (<abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> {550}), and contains only fifty-five chapters. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> concludes with an additional nine *apadānas*, numbered {551} - {559}, and comprising this fifty-sixth chapter.

[^2]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^3]: “Famous,” a historical monk, who was truly famous for being among the first sixty arahant monks with the Buddha at the first *pavāraṇā* ceremony when the Buddha sent them wandering with his so-called “Great Commission” (which I call “the Great Dismissal”). On Yasa, see DPPN II: 685-687. This same *apadāna* appears above as \#396 {399}, ascribed to a monk named “Sabbadāyaka” (in keeping with v. \[6355\] = \[3852\]), verbatim except for a slight change in the first verse of the three-verse concluding refrain,a minor variation in the epithet “Sacrificial Recipient” at \[6347\] (cf. \[3844\]), and consistency with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> rather than <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> readings in \#396. This and the following eight *apadānas* are all ascribed to historical monks seemingly not included in the earlier parts of the text, who thereby are revealed to be in the earlier parts of the text after all, named for their original pious deeds rather than by their own names.

[^4]: *ogayha*, “submerged in” “plunged into.” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> normalizes this by glossing “in the vicinity of the great ocean,” but I take it more literally, and assume that the protagonist is a supernatural being for whom this *is* normal.

[^6]: RD says this is a water-plant, a kind of lotus, referencing J iv.539; vi.47, 279, 564. Here <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss is *helmällen*, *heḷmäli* = edible white water-lily, Nymphaea Lotus, also the (or a) gloss at \[4231\], \[4233\], \[4313\]. But elsewhere <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gives different glosses: at \[4007\] <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> glosses it as *madāra* tree \[mountain-ebony, Bauhinia purpurea (*Legum.*)\] and says the blossoms fell into the water from overhanging trees. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss at \[324\] is “a water-born plant named *Mandālā*”. At \[171\] <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinh. gloss is *taḍāgayangen*, “from the moss,” following its reading of \[170\] “well fixed \[in the mosses\]”. Bot. Dict. *taḍāga* = *sevela*.

[^17]: *pampakā*, Sinh. gloss *huṇapupulō* (Sorata = *uṇahapuḷuvā*), a small, tailless monkey. Its high-pitched cry, which famously (and frighteningly) resembles that of a cobra, is apparently the reason these have been included in the present list of (mostly) birds known for their cries.
