### \[480. {483.}[^1] Bhisadāyaka[^2]\]

I, having plunged into a pond,  
served by various elephants,  
am pulling up lotus root there,  
because \[they’re what\] I’m eating then. (1) \[5057\]

The Buddha[^3] in that period  
bore the name Padumuttara.  
Wearing cloth \[dyed\] red,[^4] the Buddha  
is traveling[^5] through the sky \[there\],  
shaking \[his\] robes made out of rags.  
Then I heard the sound \[of his robes\],  
\[and\] looking[^6] upward \[at the sky,\]  
I saw the Leader of the World. (2-3) \[5058-5059\]

Remaining in that very place,  
I invited the World-Leader:  
“Honey is flowing from the roots  
\[and\] milk \[and\] oil[^7] \[flow\] from the stems;  
let the Buddha, the Eyeful One,  
with pity accept \[some\] from me.”  
Then the Teacher, Compassionate,  
the Greatly Famed One, descended. (4-5a-b) \[5060-5061\][^8]

The Eyeful One, with pity then,  
accepted \[that\] alms food of mine.  
Accepting \[it\], the Sambuddha  
expressed \[his\] thanks to me \[like this\]: (5c-d, 6a-b) \[5062\]

“Be happy, O merit-filled one;  
let your rebirth be accomplished.  
Due to this gift of lotus root,  
may you receive huge happiness.” (6c-f) \[5063\]

Having said that, the Sambuddha,  
the one whose name was “Best Lotus,”  
the Sambuddha, taking \[that\] food,  
the Victor flew off[^9] through the sky. (7) \[5064\]

Having taken \[more\] lotus root,  
I came \[back\] to my hermitage.  
Hanging that root up in a tree,  
I remembered my offering. (8) \[5065\]

A massive wind\[-storm\] then arose:  
it agitated[^10] the forest.  
The space was filled up with the noise  
of thunderbolts bursting forth \[there\]. (9) \[5066\]

Then lightening falling \[from the sky,\]  
struck[^11] \[me right\] on \[top of\] my head.  
\[Because of that,\] sitting down,  
I passed away \[right\] on the spot. (10) \[5067\]

\[Then\] bound up with my good[^12] karma,  
I was reborn in Tusitā.  
\[When\] my \[human\] body fell down,  
I delighted in the gods’ world. (11) \[5068\]

Eighty-six thousand women \[then,\]  
decked out \[in fine clothes and jewelry,\]  
wait on me evening and morning:  
the fruit of giving lotus root. (12) \[5069\]

Having come to a human womb,  
I am then happy all the time.  
I have no lack of possessions:  
the fruit of giving lotus root. (13) \[5070\]

Having \[then\] been pitied by him,  
the God of Gods, the Neutral One,  
all defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (14) \[5071\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave that alms food back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of giving lotus root. (15) \[5072\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (16) \[5073\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (17) \[5074\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (18) \[5075\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bhisadāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bhisadāyaka Thera is finished.
