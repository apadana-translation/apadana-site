### \[239. Jagatikāraka[^1]\]

When Atthadassi, the World’s Lord,  
the Best of Men, reached nirvana,  
the landscaping was done by me  
for the Buddha’s superb stupa. (1) \[2456\]

In the eighteen hundred aeons  
since I did that karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of \[good\] landscaping. (2) \[2457\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (3) \[2458\]

Thus indeed Venerable Jagatikāraka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Jagatikāraka Thera is finished.

[^1]: ”Landscaper,” reading *jagatī*, earth, ground + *kāraka*, doer; lit., “earth-developer”
