### \[388. {391.}[^1] Pilindava<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha[^2]\]

In the city, Haṃsavatī,  
I was a gate-keeper[^3] back then.  
Undisturbable,[^4] boundless wealth  
was heaped up for me in the house. (1) \[3374\]

\[While\] sitting down in solitude,  
having \[greatly\] gladdened \[my\] mind,  
seated in the splendid palace,  
I contemplated thus back then: (2) \[3375\]

“Much wealth has been obtained by me;  
I have an opulent harem.  
King Ānanda,[^5] lord of the earth,  
himself invited \[me to come\].[^6] (3) \[3376\]

And \[now\] this Buddha has been born,  
the Spontaneously Born[^7] Sage.[^8]  
And \[all this\] wealth exists for me;  
I will give gifts[^9] to the Teacher. (4) \[3377\]

The royal prince, \[named\] Paduma,[^10]  
gave splendid gifts for the Victor:  
strong[^11] elephants and palanquins  
and large[^12] supports[^13] \[to hold them up\]. (5) \[3378\]

I’ll also give gifts[^14] to the monks[^15]  
with virtue supremely splendid.[^16]  
I will be the instigator[^17]  
of other \[things\] not yet given.”[^18] (6) \[3379\]

Thinking through varied[^19] donations[^20]  
of which the fruit is happiness,  
I lit on[^21] a requisites-gift,[^22]  
\[which would\] fulfill my intentions: (7) \[3380\]

“I shall donate the requisites[^23]  
for the monks of splendid virtue.[^24]  
I will be the instigator[^25]  
of other \[things\] not yet given.”[^26] (8) \[3381\]

Approaching the basket-makers,[^27]  
I made an umbrella to last,[^28]  
bringing together into one,  
a hundred thousand umbrellas. (9) \[3382\]

I brought together into one,  
a hundred thousand \[strips of\] cloth,  
I brought together into one,  
a hundred thousand begging bowls. (10a-b)[^29] \[3383\]

And also small knives[^30] \[and\] hatchets,[^31]  
needles[^32] \[and\] clippers for the nails.[^33]  
Having \[them\] made fit for that I  
hung \[them\] beneath the umbrella. (10c-d, 11a-b) \[3384\]

I had fans[^34] made fit for that \[too\],  
fans \[made out\] of palmyra \[fronds\],[^35]  
peacock-feathers[^36] and tails of yaks;[^37]  
water-strainers,[^38] oil-containers.[^39] (11c-d, 12a-b) \[3385\]

I likewise had made, fit for that,  
needle-cases[^40] \[and\] shoulder straps[^41]  
as well as girdles for the waist[^42]  
and \[also\] well-constructed stools.[^43] (12c-d, 13a-b) \[3386\]

Filling vessels made for eating  
and also copper \[oil\] beakers  
with medicines, I fixed those too  
on the umbrella’s underside. (13b-c, 14a-b) \[3387\]

I filled vessels with all \[of this\]:  
sweet-flag,[^44] cuscus grass,[^45] licorice,[^46]  
pepper,[^47] also black peppercorns,[^48]  
myrobalan[^49] \[and\] ginger[^50] \[too\]. (14c-d, 15a-b) \[3388\]

I likewise had made, fit for that,  
shoes \[for the feet\],[^51] \[and\] sandals[^52] \[too\],  
towels[^53] \[to use after bathing\],  
\[and\] well-constructed walking-sticks.[^54] (15c-d, 16a-b) \[3389\]

Tubes for holding herbs[^55] and ointments,[^56]  
sticks of caustic,[^57] pots to keep things,[^58]  
\[locks with their\] keys[^59] and key-cases[^60]  
sewn with \[cloth\] of the five colors. (16c-d, 17a-b) \[3390\]

I likewise had made, fit for that,  
bandages[^61] and \[also\] smoke-tubes,[^62]  
lamp-holders[^63] and water-vessels,[^64]  
and baskets \[woven\] of wicker.[^65] (17c-d, 18a-b) \[3391\]

I likewise had made, fit for that,  
tweezers[^66] \[to pull\], scissors \[to cut\],[^67]  
bags[^68] for \[containing\] medicines  
and tools for removing ear-wax.[^69] (18c-d, 19a-b) \[3392\]

I \[likewise\] had made, fit for that,  
and fixed beneath \[that\] umbrella,  
long benches[^70] as well as short chairs[^71]  
and couches[^72] fashioned with four \[legs\].[^73] (19c-d, 20a-b)
\[3393\]

I likewise had made, fit for that,  
wool cushions[^74] and cotton cushions,[^75]  
cushions \[fashioned\] for the small chairs  
and very well made pillows[^76] \[too\]; (20c-d, 21a-b) \[3394\]

massaging stones[^77] and honeycombs,[^78]  
and oil for warming up the hands,[^79]  
small cases,[^80] planks[^81] and needles[^82] \[too\],  
and a bed that was spread with rugs,[^83] (21c-d, 22a-b) \[3395\]

dwelling places[^84] and foot-towels[^85]  
and sticks \[to use\] for chairs and beds,[^86]  
toothpicks[^87] and \[also good\] tooth-sticks,[^88]  
\[and\] scents for smearing on the head,[^89] (22c-d, 23a-b) \[3396\]

wood for fires[^90] and stools \[made\] of straw,[^91]  
small plates for covering alms-bowls,[^92]  
ladles \[which are made\] for water,[^93]  
silver troughs for \[storing\] chunnam,[^94] (23c-d, 24a-b) \[3397\]

brooms[^95] and water-jugs[^96] and likewise  
garments \[to wear when\] it’s raining,[^97]  
covers for the itch when sitting[^98]  
and[^99] intermediate robes[^100] \[too\], (24c-d, 25a-b) \[3398\]

monastic robes and upper robes,[^101]  
cleaners for the mouth and the nose,[^102]  
abundant salt and sour gruel,[^103]  
honey[^104] and soured milk to drink,[^105] (25c-d, 26a-b) \[3399\]

incense,[^106] lumps of boiled rice,[^107] and rags,[^108]  
napkins with which to wipe the face:[^109]  
whatever ought to be given  
which is fitting for the Teacher,  
after assembling all of that  
I went up to \[King\] Ānanda.[^110]  
After going up to the king,  
the father[^111] of the Greatest Sage,[^112]  
having saluted with \[my\] head,  
I spoke these words \[to him back then\]: (26c-d, 27-28) \[3400-3401\]

\[Protagonist:\][^113]  
“Together \[we were\] born \[and\] raised;  
\[we\] are both of a single mind,[^114]  
and[^115] in common \[we\] both follow  
\[one course\] through happiness and pain.”[^116] (29) \[3402\]

\[King:\]  
“O conqueror of foes[^117] you have  
dissatisfaction[^118] in the mind.  
If you can, warrior, you should  
remove that dissatisfaction. (30) \[3403\]

Your dissatisfaction is mine;[^119]  
\[we\] are both of a single mind.[^120]  
Know mine as ‘eliminated’  
if yours \[has been expelled as well\].” (31) \[3404\]

\[Protagonist:\]  
“Know of me,[^121] O great king, that my  
suffering[^122] is hard to remove.  
\[If you’re\] able[^123] you should shout[^124] \[it\]: (32) \[3405\]

one[^125] boon[^126] hard for you to grant[^127] \[me\].”  
\[King:\]  
“As long as \[I have\] victory,  
to the \[whole\] extent of my life,  
if it would be useful[^128] to you,  
without wavering I’ll give[^129] \[it\].” (33) \[3406\]

\[Protagonist:\]  
“This has been roared[^130] by you O king,[^131]  
\[but\] too much roaring would be wrong.”  
\[King:\]  
“Today I’ll recognize you as  
the one supported in all things.”[^132] (34) \[3407\]

\[Protagonist:\]  
“\[When\] you know \[what\] I \[want to\] give  
you’ll obdurately[^133] put \[me\] down.”[^134]  
\[King:\]  
“What’s the point of me stopping you?[^135]  
You should declare your wish to me!” (35) \[3408\]

\[Protagonist:\]  
“I am desirous, O great king,  
of feeding \[him\], the Sambuddha,  
the Best Buddha, the Unexcelled;  
do not let my life be wasted!”[^136] (36) \[3409\]

\[King:\]  
“I’ll[^137] give a different boon[^138] to you:  
the Thus-Gone-One’s not to be begged;[^139]  
to no one should the Thus-Gone-One  
be given, like a wishing-gem.”[^140] (37) \[3410\]

\[Protagonist:\]  
“O king did you not \[just\] say[^141] \[that\]  
you’d even \[give me\] your own[^142] life?  
The Thus-Gone-One is fit to give  
by one giving \[his very\] life.” (38) \[3411\]

\[King:\]  
“The Great Hero is kept apart;  
to no one should he[^143] be given.  
The Buddha’s not promised by me;  
choose[^144] limitless riches \[instead\].” (39) \[3412\]

\[Protagonist:\]  
“Let us arrive at a judgement;  
we’ll question in a court of law.  
They[^145] will declare the proper path;[^146]  
we will inquire about it thus.” (40) \[3413\]

Having taken the king in hand,  
I \[then\] went to the court of law.  
\[There\], in front of \[all\] the judges,[^147]  
I spoke these words \[to them back then\]: (41) \[3414\]

\[Protagonist:\]  
“Listen to me, O \[you\] judges:  
the king did give a boon to me.  
Without excepting anything  
he offered even \[his own\] life.[^148] (42) \[3415\]

When he had given me \[that\] boon,  
I wished for the Best of Buddhas.  
The Buddha’s well-given to me;  
otherwise I am full of doubt.”[^149] (43) \[3416\]

\[Judges:\]  
“We’ll listen[^150] to \[these\] words of yours  
\[and\] of the earth-protecting king.  
Listening to the words of both  
we shall cut off \[all of\] your doubts. (44) \[3417\]

O king, \[did\] you give everything,\
to this man, all-inclusively,[^151]  
without excepting anything,  
\[and\] offer even \[your own\] life?” (45) \[3418\]

\[King:\]  
“Fallen into misery,[^152] he  
requested an unexcelled boon.  
Knowing him to be so upset,[^153]  
I gave \[it\], all-inclusively.” (46) \[3419\]

\[Judges:\]  
“You are defeated \[here\], O king;  
the Thus-Gone-One should be given.  
The doubts of both have been cut off;  
stand firm in \[this,\] the proper path.”[^154] (47) \[3420\]

\[Protagonist/narrator:\]  
The king being put in \[his\] place  
\[then\] said these \[words\] to the judges:  
\[King:\]  
“Fair[^155] to me too you should return[^156]  
\[him\]; again I’ll get the Buddha.” (48) \[3421\]

\[Judges, to protagonist:\]  
“Having fulfilled your intentions,  
after feeding the Thus-Gone-One,  
you should return[^157] the Sambuddha  
to \[King\] Ānanda of \[great\] fame.” (49) \[3422\]

\[Protagonist:\]  
Having saluted the judges  
and also the king,[^158] Ānanda,  
\[then\] happy, being delighted,  
I went up to the Sambuddha. (50) \[3423\]

Having approached the Sambuddha,  
the Flood-Crosser, the Undefiled,  
after saluting with \[my\] head,  
I spoke these words \[to him back then\]: (51) \[3424\]

“Give your consent, O Eyeful One,  
causing \[my\] heart to \[start\] laughing;  
approach my residence along  
with the hundred thousand masters.”[^159] (52) \[3425\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
the Eyeful One gave \[his\] consent,  
discerning what I was thinking. (53) \[3426\]

Perceiving \[that he gave\] consent,  
after saluting the Teacher,  
happy, with rapture in \[my\] heart,  
I went up to my residence. (54) \[3427\]

Assembling friends and ministers  
I spoke these words \[to them back then\]:  
“I got what’s very hard to get,  
just like a wish-fulfilling gem.” (55) \[3428\]

\[Friends and Ministers:\]  
“With what \[then\] will we worship[^160] him?  
The Victor[^161] is the Boundless One,[^162]  
Beyond Compare,[^163] Unmatched,[^164] Hero,[^165]  
Unmeasurable,[^166] Unequaled.”[^167] (56) \[3429\]

And thus also Always the Same,[^168]  
Without a Second,[^169] Bull of Men.[^170]  
Service that’s hard for you to do  
is suitable for the Buddha. (57) \[3430\]

Assembling varied flowers let  
us make a floral pavilion.[^171]  
That is what befits the Buddha;  
there will be everything-*pūjā*.” (58) \[3431\]

\[Protagonist:\]  
I made that pavilion \[out of\]  
blue lotuses,[^172] pink lotuses,[^173]  
jasmine[^174] and *atimuttaka*,[^175]  
champak[^176] and ironwood flowers.[^177] (59) \[3432\]

I spread one hundred thousand seats,  
\[which were\] shaded with umbrellas.  
The meanest seat, \[reserved\] for me,  
was superb \[and\] worth one hundred. (60) \[3433\]

I spread one hundred thousand seats,  
\[which were\] shaded with umbrellas.  
After preparing food and drink,  
I announced the time \[to begin\]. (61) \[3434\]

When I announced \[that it was\] time,  
the Great Sage, Padumuttara,  
\[then\] arrived at my residence  
with the hundred thousand masters. (62) \[3435\]

The Supreme Person \[then\] sat down,  
with the hundred thousand masters,  
on the flowery floral stage[^178]  
\[with\] the umbrella borne on top. (63) \[3436\]

In proper form[^179] and without flaws,  
the Eyeful One did \[then\] accept  
the hundred thousand umbrellas,  
\[and too\] the hundred thousand seats. (64) \[3437\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
wishing to ferry me across,  
accepted \[those things\], the Great Sage. (65) \[3438\]

One for \[every\] one \[of the\] monks,[^180]  
I gifted an alms-bowl to each.  
They put down[^181] \[their\] previous[^182] bowls;  
I carried to each a bronze[^183] bowl. (66) \[3439\]

Seven nights and days the Buddha  
sat in the floral pavilion.  
Awakening many beings,  
he turned the wheel of the Teaching.[^184] (67) \[3440\]

While he was preaching his sermon,[^185]  
eighty-four thousand \[beings then\]  
beneath the floral pavilion  
gained insight into the Teaching.[^186] (68) \[3441\]

When the seventh day had arrived,  
Padumuttara, the Great Sage,  
spoke these verses \[to the crowd\]  
from his umbrella-shaded seat: (69) \[3442\]

\[Padumuttara Buddha:\]  
“I’ll relate details of this man  
who gave to me, lacking nothing,  
this \[most\] excellent offering;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (70) \[3443\]

Tusker, solider, chariot, horse:  
a four-fold army \[he will get\];  
they will wait on him[^187] constantly:  
that’s the fruit of everything-gifts.[^188] (71) \[3444\]

Palanquins \[too\], which have been hitched[^189]  
to elephants \[and\] to horses,  
will always[^190] be on hand for him:  
that’s the fruit of everything-gifts. (72) \[3445\]

\[And\] sixty thousand chariots,  
all decorated and adorned,  
will constantly wait on this \[man\]:  
that’s the fruit of everything-gifts. (73) \[3446\]

Sixty thousand instruments[^191] \[and\]  
well-decorated kettle-drums[^192]  
will constantly make sound for him:  
that’s the fruit of everything-gifts. (74) \[3447\]

And women \[too, all\] well-made-up  
numbering eight-six thousand,  
with varied clothes and jewelry,  
wearing earrings bearing gemstones, (75) \[3448\]

with long eyelashes, lovely smiles[^193]  
and slim waists, pleasant to look at,[^194]  
constantly will wait on this \[man\]:  
that’s the fruit of everything-gifts. (76) \[3449\]

For thirty thousand aeons he  
will delight in the world of gods.  
A thousand times the lord of gods,  
he will exercise divine rule. (77) \[3450\]

One thousand times he’s going to be  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\],  
\[and he will have\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting. (78) \[3451\]

While he, endowed with good karma,[^195]  
is dwelling in the world of gods,  
a gem-umbrella will be carried  
around the world of gods for him. (79) \[3452\]

Whenever he should wish for shade,[^196]  
a cloth \[and\] flower canopy,  
recognizing this man’s wishes,[^197]  
will constantly give shade \[to him\]. (80) \[3453\]

Falling from the world of the gods,  
incited by \[his\] wholesome roots,  
in accordance with \[his\] karma,[^198]  
he’ll be a kinsman of Brahmā.[^199] (81) \[3454\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (82) \[3455\]

Seated in the monks’ Assembly,  
Gotama, Bull of the Śākyans,  
will place him in the foremost place  
of understanding everything.[^200] (83) \[3456\]

He’ll be the teacher’s follower  
by the name Pilindava<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha.  
He’ll be honored[^201] by[^202] \[all\] the gods,  
the titans[^203] and music-nymphs.[^204] (84) \[3457\]

Being beloved by[^205] all of them,  
the Buddhist monks and Buddhist nuns,  
and likewise too the laypeople,  
he will dwell without defilements.”[^206] (85) \[3458\]

\[Protagonist:\]  
Karma done a hundred thousand  
\[aeons hence\] showed me \[its\] fruit here:  
well-liberated, arrow-quick,  
I have destroyed my defilements. (86) \[3459\]

O! My karma was done so well  
in the unsurpassed merit-field.[^207]  
Having done that act in that place[^208]  
I’ve attained the unshaking state.[^209] (87) \[3460\]

A man who gave an excellent  
offering,[^210] which lacked for nothing,  
did take precedence from the start:[^211]  
that’s the fruit of that offering. (88) \[3461\]

Giving umbrellas for Buddha[^212]  
\[and\] the monks of splendid virtue,[^213]  
I experience eight results,[^214]  
in accordance with my karma: (89) \[3462\]

I’m not aware of[^215] cold \[nor\] heat,  
I am not soiled[^216] with dirt \[and\] dust,[^217]  
I am safe,[^218] free of oppression,[^219]  
\[and\] I am honored[^220] all the time. (90) \[3463\]

I am \[a person\] with soft skin,[^221]  
\[my\] mind is \[always\] very clear,[^222]  
\[and\] except[^223] for this \[present\] birth,  
as I transmigrate in the world,[^224]  
one hundred thousand umbrellas  
with all the ornaments affixed  
are carried up above my head,  
as a result[^225] of that karma. (91-92) \[3464-3465\]

Why[^226] do I lack in this lifetime[^227]  
\[such\] bearing of an umbrella?  
Because by doing all deeds[^228] I’m  
under nirvana’s umbrella.[^229] (93) \[3466\]

Giving clothes for the Well-Gone-One  
\[and\] the monks of splendid virtue,[^230]  
I experience eight results,[^231]  
in accordance with my karma: (94) \[3467\]

As I transmigrate in the world,[^232]  
I have an unblemished[^233] body,  
golden in color, beautiful,  
endowed with majesty, and smooth.[^234] (95) \[3468\]

A hundred thousand strips of cloth,  
white and yellow and \[also\] red  
are carried up above my head:  
that is the fruit of giving cloth. (96) \[3469\]

Silk cloth[^235] and woolen blankets[^236] too,  
*khoma* and also cotton cloth:[^237]  
I am getting \[them\] everywhere,  
as a result[^238] of \[giving\] them.[^239] (97) \[3470\]

Giving bowls for the Well-Gone-One  
\[and\] the monks of splendid virtue,[^240]  
I experience ten results,[^241]  
in accordance with my karma: (98) \[3471\]

I am always eating \[food\] on  
plates of gold and plates of crystal,[^242]  
also plates \[fashioned\] in silver  
\[and\] plates which are made of ruby. (99) \[3472\]

I am safe,[^243] free of oppression,[^244]  
\[and\] I am honored[^245] all the time.  
I’m in receipt of food \[and\] drink,  
clothes and couches \[to rest upon\]. (100) \[3473\]

My possessions do not run out;  
I’m one who has a steady heart.  
I’m[^246] always fond of the Teaching,  
have few flaws[^247] and am undefiled.[^248] (101) \[3474\]

In the world of gods or of men,  
these virtues follow after[^249] \[me\].  
Everywhere shade does not leave me,  
as though \[I were beneath\] a tree.[^250] (102) \[3475\]

Having given the Best Buddha,  
and likewise the monks’ Assembly,  
numerous well-made \[types\] of knives,[^251]  
bound with diverse[^252] \[styles of\] binding,  
I experience eight results,[^253]  
in accordance with my karma: (103) \[3476\][^254]

I am a god, and do not shake,[^255]  
perfected in self-confidence,[^256]  
\[have\][^257] courage[^258] \[and\] virility,[^259]  
\[and\] my mind is always alert.[^260] (104) \[3477\]

As a result of \[giving\] them,[^261]  
I am receiving everywhere  
knowledge which cuts off defilement  
\[and\] fine merit without measure. (105) \[3478\]

With pleasure in my heart I gave[^262]  
for the Buddha \[and\] for the monks,[^263]  
many scissors[^264] which were not rough[^265]  
nor uneven,[^266] and were well-washed.[^267]  
I experience five results,[^268]  
in accordance with my karma: (106) \[3479, 3480a-b\][^269]

I receive due to \[giving\] them:  
a pure heart[^270] \[and\] virility,  
patience, the loving-kindness sword,[^271]  
\[and\] the supreme[^272] wisdom-weapon[^273]  
for breaking the craving-arrow:  
knowledge as strong[^274] as a diamond.[^275] (107) \[3480c-d, 3481\]

Giving needles for the Buddha[^276]  
\[and\] the monks of splendid virtue,[^277]  
I experience five results,[^278]  
in accordance with my karma: (108) \[3482\]

Transmigrating from birth to birth,

Thus indeed Venerable Pilindava<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha[^594] Thera spoke these verses.

[^2]: cf. \#15, and note, above. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> spells the name *Piḷindava<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha*. He seems to have been a historical monk, much-mentioned in the canon and commentaries. “Pilinda” was his given name, “Va<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha” refers to his *gotta* (lineage).

[^3]: *dovārika* fr. *dvāra*. Cty (p. 480) explains that he was a very rich man (*mahaddhano mahābhogo)* born in a gate-keepers’ clan (*dovārikakule nibbatto*), which might imply that he himself was not engaged in such labor (the term can also mean “janitor). Later however (p. 481) Cty stipulates that he himself was the keeper/protector of the king’s gate (*rañño gehadvāre dvārapālako*), perhaps suggesting that this was a position of some status.

[^4]: *akkhobhaŋ*, lit., “unshaken,” “unperturbed.” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss gives *niravul*, unadulterated, unconfused, untroubled, clear. Cty explains that his wealth was such that “it was not able to be disturbed, scattered, by the king nor by the other favorites \[of his\]”

[^5]: “Joy”

[^6]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss understands this to mean that the king invited the protagonist to come and join in his almsgiving to the Buddha’s foremost monks. But that is not specified in the text. I understand being invited by the king himself to be a more general indication of his high status, paralleling his possession of wealth and of an opulent harem.

The term means “Lotus” and in the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reading would agree with “Victor,” also a distinct possibility given that the Buddha in question was Padumuttara, “Supreme Lotus”

[^104]: *madhu*

[^105]: *dadhi-pānakaŋ*. *Dadhi* is milk-curd or yoghurt; “for drinking” could imply that it has been blended into a drink like *lassi*, or could refer to drinkable whey that results from souring the milk. In the description of the *ānisaṃsas*, below (v. 196 \[3570\]) the gift is more straightforwardly just called *dadhi*, though the addition of “well-prepared” (*sampannaŋ*) does imply some sort of processing for consumption.

[^110]: Malalasekera DPPN II:211 reads this passage to imply that the protagonist gave these fabulous gifts to the king himself, but I do not see warrant for that in the text. Indeed, it is clear that these are intended as requisites for the monks; I read v. 63 \[3436\] below to refer to this mega-umbrella as placed atop the Buddha.

[^111]: lit., “progenitor,” <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> glosses “father”

[^112]: reading *mahesino* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *mahāyasaŋ*, “the progenitor of great fame”

[^113]: I have puzzled long over this difficult section of the text, and can only make sense of the Pāli by taking it as a dialogue involving multiple different parties: the protagonist (Rev. Pilindava<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha in his previous life), King Ānanda, the judges in a court of law, and the protagonist’s friends and relatives; Padumuttara Buddha also speaks various lines. <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> does not seem to be aware of this, and glosses literally without apparent understanding of some of the verses. The cty is also silent about this crucial interpretative perspective.

[^114]: lit., “of both there is a single thought”. <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> alt. read *yasaŋ*, “of both there is a single fame.”

[^116]: *sukhadukkhe*; <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reads *sukkhadukkhe*

[^117]: *arindama*, lit., “tamer of enemies.” The term is in the vocative case, addressed to the protagonist.

[^118]: *dukkhaŋ*, “suffering”

[^119]: lit., “your dissatisfaction is my dissatisfaction,” i.e., “when you are troubled in the mind, I am also troubled in the mind”

[^120]: lit., “of both there is a single thought”. <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> reads *manaŋ* (“mind”) for *mataṃ* (“thought”)

[^121]: reading *me* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *kho* (an untranslatable participle)

[^122]: *dukkha*. One would prefer to remain consistent in the translation “dissatisfaction,” but “suffering” is the more commonly known term, is appropriate to this context, and work better for the meter (and rhyme) in English.

[^123]: reading *pahu samāno* (lit., “\[I\], being able”) with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> alt. for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *bahussamāno*, “being many”

[^137]: *dammi*, lit., “I am giving”

[^138]: *varaŋ*, boon, favor.

[^139]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reads this as an imperative: *mā yā<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ittho* for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *ayā<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ittho*. In either case the grammar is fuzzy — the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> reading assumes a plural second person imperative (a royal y’all?) while the PYS reading is not a regular form of the verb.

[^140]: *maṇijotirasa*, a gemstone which fulfills wishes, a particularly valuable gem.

[^168]: *samasama*, lit., “exactly the same” or “evenly even” (or, according to Sinhala usage of the same term, “Equal”). The negative of this compound, *asamasama*, is also used as a Buddha-epithet, meaning “Impartial” (“the same in difference”), below v. 42 of *Sela-apadāna* (no. 389 {392}) = \[3623\])

[^254]: <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> and <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> agree in making this a six-footed, rather than four-footed verse. I suppose that the poets wanted to stipulate that these knives were varied in type and style, as spelled out above, and therefore were unsatisfied with the four-foot template for these statements, which would not allow for anything more than a generic “knives”.

The *ānisaṃsas* in the present verse seem to relate to what in English we’d call “keeping one’s nose clean,” though I do not know whether the same associations would typically be made in Pāli.

[^552]: *nisantitā*, lit., applying, carefully observing; I follow the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinh. gloss (*väṭahena*) in this translation of the term as “grasping” (understanding).

[^564]: *sampannaŋ*

[^565]: *dadhiŋ*

[^566]: *bhuñjāmi*. In this foot the basic meaning “eating” might be preferred, but I take the verb to refer to the “enjoyment” of mindfulness of the body, too, so defer to the more general “enjoying”.

[^567]: *amataŋ*

[^568]: reading *vittaṃ* (possessions, wealth) with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>ittaŋ* (“heart”), though <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> alt. *bhattaṃ* (“rice”) would provide the cleanest reading.

[^591]: *bhave*, lit., “in existence”

[^592]: *vepulla-javana-pañño*. The basic meaning of *javana* is “quick” and it is sometimes taken as equivalent to *sīgha*, already mentioned in the preceding verse.

[^593]: *santisukhaŋ sivaŋ*
