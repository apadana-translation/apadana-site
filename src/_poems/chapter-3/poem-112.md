### \[112. Sumaṅgala\]

Atthadassi, the Best Victor,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men,  
setting out from the monastery  
came up to the lake \[near my home\].[^1] (1) \[1687\]

The Sambuddha bathed and drank \[there,\]  
\[then he\] got out and in one robe  
the Blessed One stood on that spot,  
surveying all the directions. (2) \[1688\]

While dwelling in my residence,  
I saw the Leader of the World  
shining like the hundred-rayed \[sun\],  
glittering like \[well-crafted\] gold  
\[and\] happy, with a happy heart  
I then snapped my fingers so to  
conduct dances and also songs  
and the five kinds of music \[there\].[^2] (3-4) \[1689-1690\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,  
I surpass all \[other\] creatures  
\[and\] my glory is abundant. (5) \[1691\]

“Praise to you, O Well-Bred Person![^3]  
Praise to you, Ultimate Person!  
Having made yourself happy, Sage,  
\[now\] you are pleasing \[all\] others.” (6) \[1692\]

Having accepted, sitting down,  
the One With Good Vows caused laughter.[^4]  
I having served the Sambuddha  
was \[then\] reborn in Tusitā. (7) \[1693\]

In the sixteenth aeon ago  
eleven Eka[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}intitas[^5]  
were wheel-turners with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (8) \[1694\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (9) \[1695\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sumaṅgala Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sumaṅgala Thera is finished.
