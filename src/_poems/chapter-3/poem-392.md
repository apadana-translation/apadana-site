### \[389. {392.}[^1] Sela[^2]\]

In the city, Haṃsavatī,  
I was in charge of the roadways.[^3]  
Calling my kinsfolk together,  
I spoke these words \[to them back then\]: (1) \[3581\]

“The Buddha’s[^4] been born in the world,  
the Unsurpassed Field of Merit,  
the Foundation for Every World,[^5]  
Sacrificial Recipient. (2) \[3582\]

The kṣatriyans and city folk,  
the rich people and the brahmins,  
happy, with pleasure in \[their\] hearts,  
have[^6] formed themselves into a guild.[^7] (3) \[3583\]

Those on elephants,[^8] royal guards,[^9]  
charioteers[^10] and foot-soldiers[^11]  
happy, with pleasure in \[their\] hearts,  
have[^12] formed themselves into a guild.[^13] (4) \[3584\]

The mighty lords[^14] and the princes,[^15]  
Vaiśyas as well as the brahmins,  
happy, with pleasure in \[their\] hearts,  
have[^16] formed themselves into a guild.[^17] (5) \[3585\]

The cooks[^18] \[and\] those who dress the hair,[^19]  
the bath boys,[^20] the garland-makers,[^21]  
happy, with pleasure in \[their\] hearts,  
have[^22] formed themselves into a guild.[^23] (6) \[3586\]

The dyers,[^24] also the weavers,[^25]  
the tanners,[^26] also the bath girls,[^27]  
happy, with pleasure in \[their\] hearts,  
have[^28] formed themselves into a guild.[^29] (7) \[3587\]

The fletchers,[^30] the leather workers,[^31]  
carpenters[^32] and workers in gold,[^33]  
tinsmiths,[^34] also \[makers of\] mats,[^35]  
have[^36] formed themselves into a guild.[^37] (8) \[3588-3589\][^38]  
Hired servants[^39] \[and\] musicians,[^40]  
and numerous slaves and servants,[^41]  
to the extent of their own strength,[^42]  
have[^43] formed themselves into a guild.[^44] (9) \[3590\]

Water-bringers,[^45] wood-gatherers,[^46]  
tillers,[^47] also grass-carriers,[^48]  
to the extent of their own strength,[^49]  
have[^50] formed themselves into a guild.[^51] (10) \[3591\]

Florists[^52] and gardeners[^53] as well,  
green-grocers[^54] \[and\] fruit-carriers,[^55]  
to the extent of their own strength[^56]  
have[^57] formed themselves into a guild.[^58] (11) \[3592\]

Harlots,[^59] slave-girls who bring water,[^60]  
women who sell cakes \[or\] sell fish,[^61]  
to the extent of their own strength,[^62]  
have[^63] formed themselves into a guild.[^64] (12) \[3593\]

Come[^65] you all, gathered together,  
let us \[too\] form, as one, a group;[^66]  
let us \[now\] perform service[^67] for  
the Unsurpassed Field of Merit.” (13) \[3594\]

They, having listened to my words,  
formed a group \[to last\] for all time  
\[and\] built[^68] a well-built meeting-hall[^69]  
for \[those in\] the monks' Assembly.[^70] (14) \[3595\]

After dedicating that hall,  
elated[^71] with a happy mind,[^72]  
surrounded by all of those \[folks,\]  
I went up to the Sambuddha. (15) \[3596\]

Having approached the Sambuddha,  
the Lord of the World, Bull of Men,  
\[and\] worshipping the Teacher’s feet,  
I spoke these words \[to him back then\]: (16) \[3597\]

“These three hundred people, Hero,  
\[together\] as one \[in\] a group,  
have appointed for you, O Sage,  
this well-constructed meeting-hall.” (17) \[3598\]

The Eyeful One, accepting \[it\]  
in front of the monks’ Assembly,[^73]  
\[the Buddha\] spoke these verses \[then\],  
in front of my three hundred \[folks\]: (18) \[3599\]

“Three hundred and this best one[^74] too,  
conforming[^75] \[together\] as one,  
having made this \[great\] achievement,[^76]  
you all are going to enjoy \[it\]. (19) \[3600\]

When \[your\] last rebirth is attained,  
you all will achieve nirvana,  
the state of coolness, unsurpassed,[^77]  
unborn, undying peacefulness.” (20) \[3601\]

The Buddha prophesied like that,[^78]  
the Omniscient One,[^79] Best of Monks,[^80]  
\[and\] having heard the Buddha’s words,  
I declared \[my own\] mental bliss.[^81] (21) \[3602\]

For thirty thousand aeons I  
delighted in the world of gods.  
Five hundred times the lord of gods,  
I exercised divine rule \[there\]. (22) \[3603\]

One thousand times I \[also\] was  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\].  
While exercising divine rule  
the great gods \[all then\] worshipped \[me\]. (23) \[3604\]

Here, in this human kingdom,[^82] \[my\]  
relatives are my retinue.[^83]  
When \[my\] last rebirth was attained  
there was a brahmin, Vāseṭṭha,[^84]  
with eight hundred million in wealth;[^85]  
I was \[born as\] the son of him.  
My \[given\] name \[at birth\] was “Sela,”  
a master of Vedic science.[^86] (24-25) \[3605-3606\]

I, wandering about on foot,[^87]  
waited on[^88] by \[my\] own students,  
saw[^89] Keniya[^90] the ascetic  
with matted hair, wearing ashes,[^91]  
prepared to do a sacrifice.[^92]  
\[Having seen him\] I spoke these words:  
\[Sela:\]  
“Bringing a wife? Going to one?[^93]  
Or have you invited the king?[^94] (26-27) \[3607-3608\]

I want to do sacrifices[^95]  
for brahmins who think like the gods,[^96]  
\[but\] I’m not invited by kings  
\[and\] have not found a sacrifice.” (28) \[3609\]

\[Keniya:\]  
“There is no bringing brides for me;  
I do not go to brides \[either\].  
The one I’ve invited today  
is Best in the world with \[its\] gods,  
the Delighter of the Śākyans  
who Brings Happiness to Beings[^97]  
out of Friendship for All Creatures;[^98]  
these preparations are for him. (29-30) \[3610-3611\]

The Bright Hue of Wild Mangosteen,[^99]  
Incomparable, Unmeasurable,  
the Buddha, Unrivaled in Form,  
is invited for tomorrow. (31) \[3612\]

Like beaten[^100] \[gold\] atop a forge[^101]  
\[burning bright\] like cedar charcoal,[^102]  
the Great Hero’s like lightening bolts[^103] —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha.[^104] (32) \[3613\]

Like fire \[burning\] on a mountain,  
like the moon on the fifteenth day,[^105]  
the same color as burning reeds —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (33) \[3614\]

Fearless, Overcomer of Fear,[^106]  
the Existence-Ender,[^107] the Sage,  
The Great Hero’s like a lion —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (34) \[3615\]

Skillful in the Buddha’s Teaching,  
little to endure from others,  
Great Hero’s like an elephant —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (35) \[3616\]

Skilled in doing the Great Teaching,[^108]  
the Unmatched,[^109] Buddha-elephant,  
the Great Hero is like a bull —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (36) \[3617\]

Of Endless Beauty,[^110] Boundless Fame,  
Bearing all the Various Marks,  
the Great Hero is like Indra[^111] —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (37) \[3618\]

Strong One,[^112] Whose Group is Powerful,[^113]  
Majestic One,[^114] Hard to Approach,[^115]  
The Great Hero is like Brahmā[^116] —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (38) \[3619\]

Teaching-Reacher,[^117] Ten-Powered One,[^118]  
Master of Surpassing Power,[^119]  
the Great Hero is like the earth —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (39) \[3620\]

Full of waves \[called\] morality,  
churning knowledge of the Teaching,  
the Great Hero is like the sea —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (40) \[3621\]

Hard to Approach,[^120] Hard to Subdue,[^121]  
Unshaken,[^122] Risen Up,[^123] Lofty,[^124]  
the Great Hero’s like Mt. Meru[^125] —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (41) \[3622\]

Of Endless Knowledge, Impartial,[^126]  
Unmeasurable,[^127] Gone to the Top,[^128]  
the Great Hero is like the sky —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (42) \[3623\]

Support[^129] for Those with Fears \[and\] Frights,  
Protection[^130] for Refuge-Seekers,[^131]  
the Great Hero Provides Comfort[^132] —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (43) \[3624\]

The Abode[^133] of Wisdom and Spells,[^134]  
Merit-Field for happiness-Seekers[^135]  
the Great Hero, the Mine of Gems —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (44) \[3625\]

Comforter,[^136] the Awe-Inspirer,[^137]  
Giver of the Fruit of Monkhood,  
the Great Hero is like a cloud[^138] —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (45) \[3626\]

The Eye of the World,[^139] the Hero,[^140]  
Dispeller of Every Darkness,[^141]  
the Great Hero is like the sun —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (46) \[3627\]

Sage, Seer of the Nature[^142] of  
Emancipations from Objects,[^143]  
the Great Hero is like the moon —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (47) \[3628\]

Venerable,[^144] Raised up in the World,  
Adorned with the Auspicious Marks,  
Unmeasurable, the Great Sage —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. \[3629\][^145]

The One Whose Knowledge is Boundless,[^146]  
Morality beyond Compare,[^147]  
whose freedom has no parallel,[^148]  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (48) \[3630\]

Whose courage[^149] has no parallel,  
whose firmness is unthinkable,[^150]  
he whose exertion is the best —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (49) \[3631\]

Passion, hatred, stupidity  
and every poison is destroyed;  
the Great Hero is like a drug[^151] —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (50) \[3632\]

There’s removal of the darkness  
of all pain, defilement, disease;  
the Great Hero’s like a doctor —  
I’ve invited him, the Buddha. (51) \[3633\]

“Friend, this sound is hard to obtain,  
which has been said \[here\], “the Buddha”.  
Hearing “the Buddha,” “the Buddha,”  
you all should be joyful like me.”[^152] (52) \[3634\]

\[Sela:\]  
Not keeping my joy inside \[me\]  
it poured forth \[to those\] outside \[me\].  
I, being \[full of\] joyful thoughts,[^153]  
spoke these words \[to him at that time\]: (53) \[3635\]

“Well then where is that Blessed One,  
the World’s Best One, the Bull of Men?  
Having gone where will I see \[this\]  
Giver of the Fruit of Monkhood?” (54) \[3636\]

\[He,\] taking hold of \[my\] right arm,[^154]  
thrilled, with \[his\] hands pressed together,  
showed to me the King of Teachings,[^155]  
who Removes the Arrows of Grief. (55) \[3637\]

\[Keniya:\]  
“Do you see[^156] this massive forest,  
risen up like a great storm cloud,  
dark blue just like collyrium,  
as visible as the ocean?[^157] (56) \[3638\]

The Buddha \[now\] is dwelling there,  
the Untamed-Tamer,[^158] the \[Great\] Sage,  
instructing those who can be trained,  
making known Awakening’s parts.”[^159] (57) \[3639\]

\[Sela:\]  
Like the thirsty \[seeking\] water,  
like the hungry \[looking for\] food,  
like a cow greedy for \[its\] calf,  
I went in search of the Victor. (58) \[3640\]

Knowing manners and good conduct[^160]  
I did teach to my own students  
going into Buddha’s presence,  
restraint in line with the Teaching:[^161] (59) \[3641\]

‘Blessed Ones are Hard to Approach,  
like lions wandering alone,  
walking carefully, step by step,[^162]  
come \[along after me\], O men. (60) \[3642\]

As fearful as a snake’s venom,  
like a lion, king of the beasts,  
like a rutting tusked elephant,  
thus Buddhas are Hard to Approach. (61) \[3643\]

O men, neglecting \[any need\]  
\[that you may have\] to cough or sneeze,  
walking carefully, step by step,[^163]  
go into the Buddha’s presence. (62) \[3644\]

Buddhas are Hard to Go Up To,[^164]  
they’re Ones who Relish Solitude,  
make Little Sound,[^165] Hard to Approach,  
Revered \[in the world\] with its gods. (63) \[3645\]

When[^166] I am asking \[him\] questions,  
or exchanging friendly greetings,  
then you all should make little sound;  
stand \[there\] as though \[you were\] sages.[^167] (64) \[3646\]

Which Great Teaching he is preaching,[^168]  
peaceful, leading to nirvana,  
listen to the meaning with care,[^169]  
happily hearing the Teaching.’”[^170] (65) \[3647\]

Having approached the Sambuddha  
I exchanged greetings with the Sage.  
\[While I was\] conversing with[^171] him,  
I looked out for \[Great Man’s\] marks.[^172] (66) \[3648\]

I can see thirty of the marks,  
doubting only two of the marks:  
through his powers[^173] the Sage showed me  
\[his\] penis enclosed in a sheath.[^174] (67) \[3649\]

\[And then the Buddha\] placed his tongue  
into \[his\] ear[^175] and on his nose.  
The Victor touched \[his\] forehead’s tip[^176]  
\[and\] covered it all \[with his tongue\]. (68) \[3650\]

I, seeing his auspicious marks,  
fulfilling \[all\] the attributes,  
concluding[^177] that, “he’s a Buddha,”  
I went forth with \[all\] my students. (69) \[3651\]

I went forth into homelessness,  
together with the three hundred.  
When eight months \[still\] had not elapsed,  
we all realized nirvana.[^178] (70) \[3652\]

Together[^179] doing \[good\] karma  
for the Unsurpassed Merit-Field,  
together we transmigrated,  
together we turned \[from the world\]. (71) \[3653\]

I gave[^180] rafters[^181] \[for that new hall\],  
remaining[^182] within the guild’s rule.[^183]  
Due to that deed, well done \[by me\],  
I’m receiving eight good results.[^184] (72) \[3654\]

I’m worshipped[^185] in \[all\] directions,  
and I have food that’s ambrosial;  
I’m the support of everyone;[^186]  
I don’t experience[^187] terror.[^188] (73) \[3655\]

I don’t get \[any\] diseases,  
and I protect \[my\] long life-span.  
I am one with exquisite skin,  
I live in dwellings \[that I\] choose.[^189] (74) \[3656\]

Remaining[^190] within the guild’s rule,[^191]  
the rafters I gave[^192] \[numbered\] eight.  
Following the eighth[^193] \[I received\]  
analysis[^194] with[^195] Arahantship. (75) \[3657\]

All accomplishments accomplished,[^196]  
duties complete,[^197] defilement-free,[^198]  
\[I\] am your son \[today\], Great Sage,  
\[and\] “Eight Rafters”[^199] is \[now my\] name. (76) \[3658\]

Remaining[^200] within the guild’s rule,[^201]  
the pillars[^202] I gave[^203] \[numbered\] five.  
Due to that deed, well done \[by me\],  
I’m receiving five good results.[^204] (77) \[3659\]

I remain unshaken by love,[^205]  
I do not lack for possessions,[^206]  
I’m one whose words are taken well,[^207]  
\[and\] likewise I cause no offense.[^208] (78) \[3660\]

My mind is not out of control,[^209]  
I’m not shaken by anything,  
unstained in the dispensation,[^210]  
due to that deed, well done \[by me\]. (79) \[3661\]

I’m respectful,[^211] obedient,[^212]  
duties complete,[^213] defilement-free;[^214]  
I’m your follower, Great Hero,  
a venerated monk,[^215] O Sage. (80) \[3662\]

Making a well-made palanquin,  
I \[then\] dedicated[^216] that hall.  
Due to that deed, well done \[by me\],  
I’m receiving five good results.[^217] (81) \[3663\]

I’m born in an eminent clan,[^218]  
I become a very rich man,[^219]  
I’m one who achieves all success,[^220]  
I am not plagued with[^221] avarice.[^222] (82) \[3664\]

In \[whichever\] village \[I\] wish  
my palanquin comes to a rest,[^223]  
by means of that best palanquin,  
I travel according to wish. (83) \[3665\]

Because of that palanquin-gift,  
I removed all of \[my\] darkness.  
Sage, this monk,[^224] empowered with all  
special knowledges,[^225] worships you. (84) \[3666\]

I performed all of \[my\] duties  
\[and\] the duties of others \[too\].[^226]  
Because of that well-done deed, I  
entered the city of no fear.[^227] (85) \[3667\]

I gave food \[to the Buddha and\]  
also \[that\] well-completed hall.  
Due to that deed, well done \[by me\],  
I arrived at that best of states.[^228] (86) \[3668\]

Those who are tamers in the world,  
tame these elephants \[and\] horses.  
Employing varied punishments[^229]  
they tame by means of cruelty.[^230] (87) \[3669\]

Not like that,[^231] O Great Hero, do  
you tame men \[and\] women \[here\].  
Not using force,[^232] without weapons,[^233]  
you tame in the supreme taming.[^234] (88) \[3670\]

Praising the virtues[^235] of giving,  
\[you are\] skilled in preaching, O Sage;  
addressing a single question[^236]  
you freed the three hundred, O Sage. (89) \[3671\]

We’re tamed by the charioteer,[^237]  
well-freed,[^238] undefiled,[^239] empowered  
by all the special knowledges,  
quenched[^240] in destroying the bases.[^241] (90) \[3672\]

In the hundred thousand aeons  
since I gave that gift at that time,  
every fear has been overcome:  
that’s the fruit of giving a hall. (91) \[3673\]

My being in Buddha’s presence[^242]  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (92) \[3674\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (93) \[3675\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (94) \[3676\]

Thus indeed Venerable Sela Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Sela Thera is finished.

[^126]: *asamasamo*, “the same \[even\] in difference*.”* This epithet could be read as the grammatical negative of the compound *samasama*, lit., “exactly the same” or “evenly even” (or, according to Sinhala usage of the same term, “Equal”), which is also used as a Buddha-epithet above, v. 57 of \#388 {391} (*Pilindava<span class="diacritics" data-state="on">c</span><span class="no-diacritics" data-state="off">ch</span>cha-apadāna*) = \[3430\]. *Asama* also means “stone,” a synonym for Sela’s own name, so we could read this as meaning “The Same as Stone,” though the relationship of that quality to the nature of the sky would then prove problematic. A better alt. reading, suggested to me by H.M. Wijerathna, is “the Same as the Unmatched Ones,” (“the same as those of whom no one is an equal”), i.e., the previous Buddhas.

[^137]: *veda-kara*, “the one who makes religious feeling, religious joy, enthusiasm, emotion.” *Veda* is a wide-ranging term derived from \*vid (hence also “knowledge,” “science,” cf. *vijjā*), and of course designates the revealed poetry of the brahmins. In that latter context (whereby we could read the term, “Doer of the Veda” or even Maker of the Veda,” another possible meaning) , the literal meaning of *assāsaka* (see previous note) is especially interesting, for “Breathing” or even “the Breath” similarly evokes a theme very dear to Brahmanical thought and scripture.

The meaning could also be “you all should produce joy for me”.
