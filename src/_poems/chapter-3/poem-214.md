### \[214. Ekasaññaka[^1]\]

I saw the Teacher’s robe of rags,  
stuck up in the top of a tree.[^2]  
Having pressed my hands together  
I worshipped the \[Buddha’s\] rag-robe. (1) \[2335\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I obtained that perception then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (2) \[2336\]

In the twenty-fifth aeon hence  
there was one lord of the people  
\[known\] by the name Amitābhā,[^3]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength. (3) \[2337\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2338\]

Thus indeed Venerable Ekasaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Ekasaññaka Thera is finished.

[^1]: “One Perception”

[^2]: I follow the cty and <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss in taking *dumagge* as *duma* + *agge*. It would also be possible to take it as *du* + *magge*, “on a bad road”.

[^3]: “Unlimited Brilliance,” also the name of the Buddha of the Pure Land Sukhāvatī
