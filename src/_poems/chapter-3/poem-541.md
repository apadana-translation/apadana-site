## Bhaddiya Chapter, the Fifty-Fifth

### \[538. {541.}[^1] Lakuṇṭakabhaddiya[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the One with Eyes for everything,  
the One who had \[Five\] Eyes, arose  
a hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[6023\]

I then \[lived\] in Haṃsavatī,  
a millionaire’s son, very rich.  
\[While\] wandering about on foot,  
I went to the monks’ hermitage.[^3] (2) \[6024\]

At that time, the Torch for the World,  
the Leader was preaching[^4] *Dhamma*.  
He heaped praised on a follower,  
distinguished among the sweet-voiced. (3) \[6025\]

After hearing that, being thrilled,  
I did a deed for the Great Sage.  
Having worshipped the Teacher’s feet,  
I aspired \[to attain\] that place. (4) \[6026\]

Then amidst the monks’ Assembly,  
the Buddha, the Guide,[^5] prophesied:  
“Very far into the future,  
he’ll receive that delightful \[place\]. (5) \[6027\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (6) \[6028\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
the one whose name is Bhaddiya  
will be the Teacher’s follower.” (7) \[6029\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (8) \[6030\]

\[Then\] ninety-two aeons ago,  
the Leader \[named\] Phussa arose,  
Hard to Approach,[^6] Hard to Subdue,[^7]  
Supreme in All Worlds,[^8] the Victor. (9) \[6031\]

He was Endowed with Good Conduct,[^9]  
Lofty,[^10] Upright \[and\] Majestic,[^11]  
Wishing Well for every being,[^12]  
he freed many \[folks\] from bondage. (10) \[6032\]

I was \[then\] a speckled cuckoo,[^13]  
in his fine hermitage, “Nanda.”[^14]  
I’m living in a mango tree,  
near \[Phussa Buddha’s\] perfumed hut.[^15] (11) \[6033\]

Having seen the Supreme Victor,[^16]  
Worthy of Gifts,[^17] going for alms,  
bringing pleasure to \[my own\] heart,  
I cried out with a sweet tone then. (12) \[6034\]

Then going to the royal park,  
taking a cluster of mangoes,  
very ripe, with gold\[-colored\] skin,  
I brought \[them\] to the Sambuddha. (13) \[6035\]

Then knowing my heart, the Victor,  
with Great Compassion, the Leader,  
took \[his\] bowl \[for accepting alms\]  
from the hand of \[his\] attendant.[^18] (14) \[6036\]

“Happy-hearted I’m giving the  
Great Sage[^19] a mango-cluster placed  
in the bowl with \[both\] my wings pressed  
\[in praise,”\] I cried[^20] with a sweet tone,  
a sound delightful \[to the ears\],  
worth hearing, \[very\] beautiful,  
for the sake of Buddha-*pūjā*,  
\[then\] going to \[my\] nest[^21] laid down. (15-16) \[6037-6038\]

Then a hawk[^22] with an evil mind,[^23]  
after flying up[^24] slaughtered me,  
loving-kindness in \[my\] heart, \[my\]  
wishes turned[^25] to love of Buddha. (17) \[6039\]

Fallen from there, in Tusitā,  
having enjoyed great happiness,  
I came into a human womb ,  
through the power of that karma. (18) \[6040\]

In this \[present\] lucky aeon  
Brahmā’s Kinsman, Greatly Famed One,  
named Kassapa through \[his\] lineage,[^26]  
Best Debater,[^27] \[Buddha,\] arose. (19) \[6041\]

Lighting up the dispensation,  
overcoming evil rivals,  
instructing the instruct-able, he  
reached nirvana,[^28] with followers.[^29] (20) \[6042\]

When the World-Chief reached nirvana,  
a numerous multitude, pleased,  
are building the Teacher’s stupa,  
in order to worship[^30] Buddha. (21) \[6043\]

They counseled \[one another\] thus:  
“Let’s build for \[him\], the Sage So Great,  
a stupa that’s seven leagues \[tall\],  
adorned with \[all\] the seven gems.” (22) \[6044\]

As[^31] the leader of the army  
of the king of Kāsi,[^32] Kiki,  
I spoke of a trifling measure,  
as the measure of[^33] the stupa. (23) \[6045\]

At that time, because of my word,  
they built a stupa one league \[tall\]  
for \[him\] the Hero among Men,[^34]  
\[which was\] adorned with varied gems. (24) \[6046\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (25) \[6047\]

And now, in \[my\] final rebirth,  
I’m born in a millionaire’s clan,  
rich, prosperous, very wealthy,  
in the great city, Śrāvasti. (26) \[6048\]

At the city’s entrance seeing  
the Buddha,[^35] \[my\] mind astonished,  
going forth, in not a long time,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship. (27) \[6049\]

Due to the karma of making  
the stupa’s measure \[smaller\],  
I’m born with a dwarfish body,  
which is worthy of disrespect. (28) \[6050\]

Having worshipped[^36] the Seventh Sage  
with a sound which was honey\[-sweet\],  
I attained the top place among  
the monks with voices that are sweet. (29) \[6051\]

Due to giving the Buddha fruit,  
and \[my\] conforming with virtue,  
endowed with the fruit of monkhood,  
I am \[now\] living, undefiled. (30) \[6052\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (31) \[6053\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (32) \[6054\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (33) \[6055\]

Thus indeed Venerable Lakuṇṭakabhaddiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Lakuṇṭakabhaddiya Thera is finished.
