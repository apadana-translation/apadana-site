### \[87. Phaladāyaka[^1]\]

On a Himalayan mountain,  
wearing a rough deer-leather robe,  
with fruit in hand, I saw Phussa,  
Best Victor, \[and\] gave \[him the\] fruit. (1) \[1535\]

That fruit which I gave \[to him then\]  
with a mind that was very clear,  
came into being as fruit for me  
transmigrating in existence. (2) \[1536\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I gave that fruit \[to him back then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of giving fruit. (3) \[1537\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[1538\]

Thus indeed Venerable Phaladāyaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Phaladāyaka Thera is finished.
