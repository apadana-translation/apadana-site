### \[92. Su[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}intita[^1]\]

Happy, \[and\] with a happy heart,  
I gave a \[new\] auspicious chair[^2]  
to Tissa the Lord of the World,  
the Buddha, Kinsman of the Sun. (1) \[1560\]

Eight and thirty aeons ago  
I was the king, Mahāru[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}i.  
There were lots of riches \[for me\]  
and many beds \[to sit upon\]. (2) \[1561\]

Having given Buddha a chair  
with a mind that was very clear,  
I experienced my own karma  
well-done by myself formerly. (3) \[1562\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I gifted \[him\] that chair back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that is the fruit of a chair-gift. (4) \[1563\]

Eight and thirty aeons ago  
there were three wheel-turning monarchs:  
Ruci and Uparuci too,  
\[and\] Mahāru[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}i was the third. (5) \[1564\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (6) \[1565\]

Thus indeed Venerable Su[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}intita Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Su[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}intita Thera is finished
