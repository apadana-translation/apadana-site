### \[537. {540.}[^1] Mogharāja[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the Sage, Knower of Every World,  
the One who had \[Five\] Eyes, arose  
a hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[5987\][^3]  
The Admonisher,[^4] Instructor,[^5]  
Crosser-Over[^6] of all that breathe,  
Skilled at Preaching,[^7] \[he\], the Buddha,  
caused many folks to cross \[the flood\]. (2) \[5988\]

Merciful,[^8] Compassionate One,[^9]  
Well-Wisher[^10] of all that breathe, he  
established in the five precepts  
all the rivals who had arrived. (3) \[5989\]

In this way he was Unconfused[^11]  
and Very Well-Known[^12] by rivals,  
Ornamented[^13] by arahants  
who were masters \[and\] neutral ones. (4) \[5990\]

The \[body of the\] Sage So Great  
rose up fifty-eight cubits[^14] \[tall\];  
he was Valuable Like Gold,[^15]  
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. (5) \[5991\]

\[People’s\] lifespan at that time was  
\[fully\] one hundred thousand years.  
Remaining \[in the world\] so long,  
he ferried many folks across. (6) \[5992\]

I was then in Haṃsavatī;  
I was \[born\] in a certain[^16] clan.  
Bound to working for others,[^17] I  
did not have any possessions. (7) \[5993\]

Living on the unfinished floor[^18]  
of a storeroom for special seats,[^19]  
I lit a fire there \[on that floor\];  
the earth became hard \[and\] blackened. (8) \[5994\]

Then the Lord, explaining the Four  
Noble Truths to the retinue,  
lavished praise on a follower  
who wore inferior cloth robes.[^20] (9) \[5995\]

\[Then\] thrilled at that virtue of his,  
falling before the Thus-Gone-One,  
I aspired to that supreme place,  
foremost among those with rough robes. (10) \[5996\]

Then Buddha Padumuttara  
said this to \[all his\] followers:  
“All of you look at that person,  
with bad clothes, a skinny body,  
with joy \[and\] pleasure in \[his\] face,  
possessing a great wealth of faith,  
happy, body hair grown upward,  
steadfast, eating food in a hall.[^21] (11-12) \[5997-5998\]

He’s wishing to \[attain\] the place  
of \[this\] monk \[named\] Sa[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}asena;[^22]  
his hope’s for the appearance of  
this \[monk\] wearing robes of rough cloth.” (13) \[5999\]

After hearing that,[^23] being thrilled,  
bowing \[my\] head to the Victor,  
doing good karma my whole life[^24]  
in the Victor’s dispensation,  
due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I was gone to Tāvatiṃsa. (14-15) \[6000-6001\]

Through the deed of burning the floor  
in the storeroom for special seats,  
for all of a thousand \[years,\] I  
burned in hell, remaining in pain. (16) \[6002\]

Due to that karma’s remainder,  
I had five hundred \[more\] rebirths,  
being born in a human clan,  
\[and\] marked with the marks of \[my\] caste.[^25] (17) \[6003\]

For those same five hundred rebirths,  
I’m afflicted with skin disease,  
I underwent great suffering,  
through the power of that karma. (18) \[6004\]

In this \[present\] lucky aeon,  
having a mind \[full\] of pleasure,  
I entertained with begged alms food  
Upariṭṭha, the Famous One.[^26] (19) \[6005\]

Through the rest of the deed[^27] I did,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (20) \[6006\]

When \[my\] last[^28] rebirth was attained,  
I’m born in a warrior[^29] clan.  
After the death of my father,  
I possessed a large kingdom \[then\]. (21) \[6007\]

Afflicted with a skin disease,  
I get no comfort in the night.  
Due to useless royal comfort,[^30]  
I was then called “King of Useless.”[^31]  
Seeing the flaws of the body,  
I went forth into homelessness.  
I entered in the studentship  
of Bāvarī, the chief brahmin. (23) \[6009\]

With an enormous retinue,  
approaching the Leader of Men,[^32]  
I asked a subtle question of  
the Hero, Debater-Crusher.[^33] (24) \[6010\]

“\[In\] this world \[or in\] the next world  
\[or\] in Brahma’s world with \[its\] gods,  
\[might\] he not know the sight of you,[^34]  
of Gotama, the Famous One? (25) \[6011\]

Thus one with excellent knowledge[^35]  
comes to the point through the question,  
\[while\] looking upon what world, \[then\],  
does the King of Death not see \[him\]?” (26) \[6012\]

The Physician for all Disease,[^36]  
the Buddha answered[^37] \[this\] to me:  
“Look upon the world as empty,[^38]  
Mogharāja;[^39] always mindful,  
\[and\] uprooting his own \[false\] views,[^40]  
\[in this way\] he’d cross beyond death.  
Thusly looking upon the world,  
the King of Death does not see \[him\].” (27-28) \[6013-6014\]

And the conclusion of that verse,  
cutting off \[my\] hair and \[my\] beard,  
putting on saffron-colored robes,  
I became an arahant monk. (29) \[6015\]

Oppressed by illness I don’t live  
in Assembly monasteries.  
“Don’t offend the monastery” —  
by that word I’m extra-oppressed. (30) \[6016\]

Taking \[cloth\] atop rubbish heaps,  
from charnel field, on carriage roads,  
having made[^41] \[my\] robe out of that,  
I am wearing a rough-cloth robe. (31) \[6017\]

Pleased about[^42] that virtue of mine,  
the Great Physician,[^43] the Leader,  
\[then\] placed me in the foremost place  
of those who wear robes of rough cloth. (32) \[6018\]

Merit and evil are all destroyed;  
every illness is driven out.  
Like fire, \[I\] have no attachments;  
I will realize nirvana. (33) \[6019\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (34) \[6020\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (35) \[6021\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (36) \[6022\]

Thus indeed Venerable Mogharāja Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Mogharāja Thera is finished.

The Summary:

Ka[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}āna, Vakkalī Thera,  
the one named Mahākappina,  
Dabba, and he named Kumāra,

The Ka[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}āna Chapter, the Fifty-Fourth[^44]

[^1]: *Apadāna* numbers provided in {fancy brackets} correspond to the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> edition, which contains more individual poems than does the <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> edition dictating the main numbering of this translation.

[^2]: a historical monk. See DPPN II: 669-670

[^3]: this and the following five verses also appear, verbatim, as the first six verses of Dabbamalla’s *apadāna* (\#531 {534}, above; \[5769\]-\[5774\]), and also of Mahākoṭṭhita’s *apadāna* (\#534 {537}; \[5881\]-\[5886\]), and Uruvela-Kassapa’s *apadāna* (\#535 {538}; \[5911\]-\[5916\]), and Rādhas *apadāna* (\#536 {539}; \[5956\]-\[5961\])

[^4]: *ovādako*

[^5]: *viññāpako*

[^6]: *tārako*

[^7]: *desanākusalo*

[^8]: *anukampako*

[^9]: *kāruṇiko*

[^10]: *hitesi*

[^11]: *nirākulaŋ*

[^12]: *suñññataŋ*, or “empty \[of ill-will\],” which is <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinhala gloss reading; I construe the epithet as *su* + *ñata*

[^13]: *vi[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}ittaŋ*

[^14]: *ratanāna-aṭṭha-paññāsaŋ uggato*. A *ratana* (Sinh. *riyan*) is figured as twelve-fingers (*aṅgula*), according to Sinh-Eng Dictionary about eighteen inches. The claim here then is that Padumuttara Buddha was 1044 inches (or 87 feet) tall.

[^15]: *kañ[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}anagghiyasaṅkāso*, lit., “like a gold valuable thing” or “like a gold festoon work”

[^16]: *aññatare* implies “undistinguished” here

[^17]: i.e., an itinerant worker or a servant

[^18]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinh. gloss (*piriyam no kaḷa bimhi*) seems to take the Pāli as *vasanto ‘katabhūmiyaṃ* (“on an unfinished floor”) rather than (as both editions have it), *vasanto katabhūmiyan*, which means the opposite (“on a finished floor”). The reference to “the earth” (*mahī*) in the final foot may be why the <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> editor reads it this way, and I follow suit, though it is unclear to me why blackening an unfinished floor would be problematic enough to cause the terrible consequences it does for the protagonist.

[^19]: *paṭikkamanasālāyaŋ*, following RD. The sense is of a building whose purpose is keeping the chairs, cushions, mats or what have you that are appointed for distinguished visitors. As the Buddha and monks would have been among the latter, the sooting up of the floor seems to have been especially grave.

[^20]: *lūkha[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}īvaradhārakaŋ*. *Lūkha°* refers to rough, inferior cloth discarded by tailors

[^21]: *sālapiṇḍitaŋ*, <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinh. gloss “who has *sālapiṇḍa* (“a lump of food in a hall” “a lump of *sal* “

[^22]: “Truth-Army”

[^23]: oddly, here the Buddha does not draw the conclusion that the protagonist will indeed attain that foremost place; perhaps a verse or two has been lost?

[^24]: lit., “for as long as \[I\] lived”

[^25]: reading *jātiyā lakkhaṇaṅkito* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *tatiyākāraṇ’ aṅkita* (“marked in the third mine”?)

[^26]: <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> gloss explains that he was a *pa[cc]{.diacritics data-state=on}[chch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}ekabuddha* or “Lonely Buddha” who realizes nirvana without teaching the path (as does a Sammāsambuddha). Reading *upariṭṭhaṃ yasassinaṃ* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *upaṭṭhitaŋ yasassinaŋ* (“I waited on the famous”)

[^27]: lit., “the karma”

[^28]: taking <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> *ma[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}chime* (for *pa[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}chime*) as a typographical error

[^29]: lit., “kṣatriyan”

[^30]: *mogharajjasukhan yasmā*

[^31]: *Mogharājā*

[^32]: *naranāyakaŋ*

[^34]: reading *diṭṭhiṃ te nābhijānāti* with <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> for <abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr> *diṭṭhi no nâbhijānāmi*, and following <abbr title="Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series">BJTS</abbr> Sinh. gloss.

[^35]: or “excellent knowledge,” see under RD *abhikkanta*, s.v. (*°dassāvin*)
