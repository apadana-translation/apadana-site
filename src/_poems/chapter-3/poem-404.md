### \[401. {404.}[^1] Dhotaka[^2]\]

The River named Bhāgīrathī[^3]  
is fed by the Himalayas.  
It is always flowing along,  
past[^4] the gate of Haṃsavatī. (1) \[3962\]

The hermitage named Sobhita,[^5]  
well-built, is on the river’s slopes.  
The Buddha, Padumuttara,  
the World’s Leader, was dwelling there. (2) \[3963\]

He was honored the people,  
like Indra by the thirty \[gods\].  
The Blessed One was seated[^6] there  
fearlessly \[just\] like a lion. (3) \[3964\]

I was a brahmin living in  
the city of Haṃsavatī.  
My name \[back then\] was Chalaṇga,[^7]  
named thus \[because\] I was a sage. (4) \[3965\]

One thousand eight hundred[^8] students  
were surrounding me at that time.  
Joined together[^9] with those students,  
I went up to the riverbank. (5) \[3966\]

At that place I saw \[Buddhist\] monks,  
without deceit,[^10] cleansed of evil,[^11]  
crossing Bhāgīrathī \[River\].  
At that time I reflected thus: (6) \[3967\]

“These sons of Buddha, of great fame,  
are crossing evening and morning;  
they are being troubled themselves,  
\[and\] their things[^12] are getting ruined. (7) \[3968\]

The Buddha’s said to be the Chief  
of the world including the gods.  
I have not \[yet\] made donations[^13]  
that would cleanse \[my\] road to rebirth. (8) \[3969\]

Why then don’t I get a bridge built  
on the river for Best Buddha?  
Causing that work to be done,[^14] I’ll  
transmigrate in this existence.” (9) \[3970\]

Donating a hundred thousand  
I had a bridge built \[for him there\],  
trusting that “doing this deed[^15] will  
be of great \[advantage\] to me.[^16]” (10) \[3971\]

Having caused \[that\] bridge to be built,  
I went up to the World-Leader.  
Hands pressed together on \[my\] head,  
I spoke these words \[to him back then\]: (11) \[3972\]

“Donating[^17] one hundred thousand,  
I’ve caused this magnificent[^18] bridge  
to be constructed for your sake;  
please accept \[it\], O Sage So Great.” (12) \[3973\]

Padumuttara, World-Knower,  
Sacrificial Recipient,  
seated in the monks’ Assembly,  
spoke these verses \[about me then\]: (13) \[3974\]

“He who had \[this\] bridge built for me,  
\[feeling well-\]pleased by \[his\] own hands,  
I shall relate details of him;  
\[all of\] you listen to my words: (14) \[3975\]

Fallen into[^19] a cave[^20] or from  
\[the top of\] a mountain or tree,  
even dying[^21] he will get caught:[^22]  
that’s the fruit of giving bridges. (15) \[3976\]

As the wind[^23] \[does not disturb\] a  
banyan[^24] spreading \[its\] growing roots,[^25]  
enemies[^26] will not defeat[^27] \[him\]:  
that’s the fruit of giving bridges. (16) \[3977\]

No thieves are going to defeat[^28] him[^29]  
and the king[^30] will not despise \[him\].  
He’ll surpass all \[his\] enemies:[^31]  
that’s the fruit of giving bridges. (17) \[3978\]

\[Even\] in an unsheltered space,  
being scorched by the \[sun’s\] harsh heat,  
conforming with \[his\] good karma,[^32]  
he won’t feel any discomfort.[^33] (18) \[3979\]

In the world of gods or of men,  
a well-built elephant-carriage  
all of the time will come to be,  
discerning what he is thinking. (19) \[3980\]

A thousand fast carriages with  
Sindh horses as quick as the wind  
will come to \[him\] evening and morning:  
that’s the fruit of giving bridges. (20) \[3981\]

Having come to the human state,  
this one is going to be happy;  
here too for \[this\] very man the  
elephant-carriage will appear.[^34] (21) \[3982\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (22) \[3983\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
knowing well all the defilements  
he’ll reach nirvana, undefiled.” (23) \[3984\]

O! that karma well-done by me  
for him whose name is “Best Lotus.[^35]”  
Having done that deed[^36] \[for him\] there,  
I attained \[my\] arahantship.[^37] (24) \[3985\]

Having put forth exertion,[^38] I’m  
calmed,[^39] devoid of grounds for rebirth;[^40]  
like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (25) \[3986\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
All defilements are exhausted;  
now there will be no more rebirth. (26) \[3988\][^41]  
Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (27) \[3987\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (28) \[3989\]

Thus indeed Venerable Dhotaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Dhotaka Thera is finished.
