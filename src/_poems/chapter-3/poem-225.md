### \[225. Avyādhika[^1]\]

I gave a heated room[^2] \[back then\]  
to Vipassi, the Blessed One,  
and a residence for the ill  
which was furnished with hot water. (1) \[2396\]

As a result of that good deed,  
my own state of being is good.[^3]  
I have come to know no illness:  
that is the fruit of good karma.[^4] (2) \[2397\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I donated that heated room,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of a heated room. (3) \[2398\]

In the seventh aeon ago  
there was one Aparājita,[^5]  
a wheel-turning king with great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (4) \[2399\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2400\]

Thus indeed Venerable Avyādhika Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Avyādhika Thera is finished.
