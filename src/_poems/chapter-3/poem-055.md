### \[55. Opavuyha[^1]\]

To Padumuttara Buddha  
I gave a \[fine\] thoroughbred \[horse\].  
Assigning it to the Buddha,[^2]  
I \[then\] went \[back\] to my own house. (1) \[1290\]

The Teacher’s top follower was  
\[the monk\] whose name was Devala.[^3]  
Worthy heir to the best Teaching  
he came into my presence \[then\]. (2) \[1291\]

“The Blessed One bears his own bowl;  
he will not use a thoroughbred.  
The Eyeful One accepted it  
\[because\] he had discerned your thoughts.” (3) \[1292\]

I got the price for that wind-quick  
speed vehicle \[that came\] from Sindh.  
\[Then\] I gave a suitable[^4] \[gift\]  
to Padumuttara Buddha. (4) \[1293\]

In whichever womb I’m reborn,  
\[whether\] it’s human or divine,[^5]  
suitable, and variegated[^6]  
Sindh-horses[^7] \[then\] arise for me. (5) \[1294\]

The gain for them is well-received  
who undergo ordination.[^8]  
If a Buddha’s born in the world  
\[then\] they should serve him constantly. (6) \[1295\]

I was a king with great power  
twenty-eight \[different\] times \[back then\],  
lord of the grove of rose-apples,[^9]  
victorious on \[all\] four sides.[^10] (7) \[1296\]

This is the final time for me;  
\[my\] last rebirth is proceeding.[^11]  
I’ve attained the unshaking state  
beyond[^12] \[all\] conquest and defeat. (8) \[1297\]

Thirty-four thousand \[aeons thence\]  
there was a king[^13] of great power,  
a wheel-turner who had great strength,  
possessor of the seven gems. (9) \[1298\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (10) \[1299\]

Thus indeed Venerable Opavuyha Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Opavuyha Thera is finished.
