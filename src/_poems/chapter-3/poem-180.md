### \[180. Saṅghupaṭṭhāka[^1]\]

When Vessabhu was the Buddha,[^2]  
I was a forest-dweller \[then\].  
With a pleased heart \[and\] happy mind,  
I did serve the best Assembly. (1) \[2148\]

In the thirty-one aeons since  
I did that \[good\] karma back then,  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of doing service. (2) \[2149\]

In the seventh aeon ago,  
there were seven Samotthatas,[^3]  
wheel-turning kings with great power,  
possessors of the seven gems. (3) \[2150\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[2151\]

Thus indeed Venerable Saṅghupaṭṭhāka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Saṅghupaṭṭhāka Thera is finished.
