### \[89. Bodhisaññaka[^1]\]

There was a great Bodhi festival  
for the Blessed One Vipassi.  
I attended that festival,  
being a person who’d renounced. (1) \[1542\]

Taking water strewn with flowers  
I poured it on the Bodhi \[Tree\].  
“Freed, he will make \[all of\] us free;  
Gone Out, he will make us go out.” (2) \[1543\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I watered that Bodhi \[Tree then\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
the fruit of Bodhi-perception. (3) \[1544\]

When thirty-three aeons had passed  
there were eight wheel-turning kings,  
lords over men who were \[all then\]  
known as Udakāse[c]{.diacritics data-state=on}[ch]{.no-diacritics data-state=off}ana.[^2] (4) \[1545\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[1546\]

Thus indeed Venerable Bodhisaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Bodhisaññaka Thera is finished.
