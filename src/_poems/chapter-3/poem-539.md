### \[536. {539.}[^1] Rādha[^2]\]

The Victor, Padumuttara,  
the Sage, Knower of Every World,  
the One who had \[Five\] Eyes, arose  
a hundred thousand aeons hence. (1) \[5956\][^3]  
The Admonisher,[^4] Instructor,[^5]  
Crosser-Over[^6] of all that breathe,  
Skilled at Preaching,[^7] \[he\], the Buddha,  
caused many folks to cross \[the flood\]. (2) \[5957\]

Merciful,[^8] Compassionate One,[^9]  
Well-Wisher[^10] of all that breathe, he  
established in the five precepts  
all the rivals who had arrived. (3) \[5958\]

In this way he was Unconfused[^11]  
and Very Well-Known[^12] by rivals,  
Ornamented[^13] by arahants  
who were masters \[and\] neutral ones. (4) \[5959\]

The \[body of the\] Sage So Great  
rose up fifty-eight cubits[^14] \[tall\];  
he was Valuable Like Gold,[^15]  
Bearing the Thirty-Two Great Marks. (5) \[5960\]

\[People’s\] lifespan at that time was  
\[fully\] one hundred thousand years.  
Remaining \[in the world\] so long,  
he ferried many folks across. (6) \[5961\]

I then \[lived\] in Haṃsavatī,  
brahmin master of the mantras.  
Approaching the Excellent Man,[^16]  
I heard the preaching of *Dhamma*, (7) \[5962\]

the Great Hero, the \[World-\]Leader,  
Confident among Multitudes,[^17]  
appointing[^18] a monk with quick wit,[^19]  
in that \[quality’s\] foremost place. (8) \[5963\]

After doing deeds at that time  
for the Leader and Assembly,  
having bowed \[my\] head at \[his\] feet,  
I aspired \[to attain\] that place. (9) \[5964\]

With his lovely voice[^20] conveying  
away \[all\] defilements \[and\] stains,  
he as Shiny as Gold Ingots,[^21]  
the Blessed One then said to me,  
“May you be happy and long-lived;  
your intention is accomplished.  
Hugely[^22] \[fruitful\] for you \[will be\]  
\[this\] deed done for the monks[^23] and me. (10-11) \[5965-5966\]

In one hundred thousand aeons,  
arising in Okkāka’s clan,  
the one whose name is Gotama  
will be the Teacher in the world. (12) \[5967\]

Worthy heir to that one’s *Dhamma*,  
*Dhamma*’s legitimate offspring,  
the one given the name Rādha  
will be the Teacher’s follower.” (13) \[5968\]

Glad by reason of your virtue,[^24]  
the Śākyas’ Son, the Bull of Men,  
the Leader’s going to appoint \[you\]  
foremost of those who have quick wit.” (14) \[5969\]

After hearing that I was thrilled,  
\[and\] then for as long as \[I\] lived,  
mindful, loving-hearted \[and\] wise,  
I waited on[^25] \[him\], the Victor. (15) \[5970\]

Due to that karma done very well,  
with intention and \[firm\] resolve,  
discarding \[my\] human body,  
I went to Tāvatiṃsa \[then\]. (16) \[5971\]

Three hundred times \[the lord of gods,\]  
I exercised divine rule \[there\],  
and \[then\] five hundred times I was  
a king who turns the wheel \[of law\]. (17) \[5972\]

\[There was also\] much local rule,  
innumerable by counting.  
Through the power of that karma,  
I was happy in every place. (18) \[5973\]

When \[my\] last rebirth was attained,  
I was born in a brahmin clan,  
poor,[^26] \[and\] wanting for clothes and food,  
in Rajgir, ultimate city.[^27] (19) \[5974\]

I gave a ladle’s worth of food  
to Sāriputta, neutral one,  
when \[I\] was old and decrepit,  
and I came to \[his\] hermitage. (20) \[5975\]

Nobody was ordaining[^28] me,  
being old \[and\] of failing strength;[^29]  
due to that, old and discolored,  
I was sorrow\[ful\] at that time. (21) \[5976\]

Having seen me, Great Compassion,[^30]  
the Sage So Great said \[this\] to me:  
“What meaning has this sorrow, son?  
Tell me of your mental anguish.” (22) \[5977\]

“I’m not getting ordained, Hero,  
in your well-preached dispensation;  
thus I’m miserable with grief;  
be \[my\] refuge, O Leader.” (23) \[5978\]

Then calling the monks together,  
the Seventh Sage questioned \[them thus\]:  
“Let them speak, those who remember  
the service of this one \[for us\].” (24) \[5979\]

Sāriputta spoke at that time:  
“I remember his deed \[for us\].  
He gave a ladleful of food  
to me \[then\] wandering for alms.” (25) \[5980\]

Excellent, Excellent, grateful  
Sāriputta! \[Now\] you ordain  
this \[man, an\] elderly brahmin;  
he’s going to be a thoroughbred.[^31] (26) \[5981\]

Then \[I\] got to go forth \[and got\]  
ordained with proper ritual.[^32]  
In a short time \[I then\] attained  
destruction of the defilements.[^33] (27) \[5982\]

Thrilled \[and\] mindful, I’m listening  
carefully to the Sage’s words.  
Then the Victor placed me in the  
foremost place of those with quick wit. (28) \[5983\]

My defilements are \[now\] burnt up;  
all \[new\] existence is destroyed.  
Like elephants with broken chains,  
I am living without constraint. (29) \[5984\]

Being in Best Buddha’s presence  
was a very good thing for me.  
The three knowledges are attained;  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (30) \[5985\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (31) \[5986\]

Thus indeed Venerable Rādha Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Rādha Thera is finished.
