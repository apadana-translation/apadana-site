### \[188. Tikaṇṇipupphiya[^1]\]

I, being \[then\] a deity,  
honored by celestial nymphs,[^2]  
reborn \[due to my\] past karma,  
recalled \[him\], the Best of Buddhas. (1) \[2197\]

Having plucked three *kaṇṇi* flowers,  
bringing pleasure to \[my\] own mind,  
I offered \[them\] to the Buddha  
Vipassi, the Bull among Men. (2) \[2198\]

In the ninety-one aeons since  
I offered that flower \[to him\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of Buddha-*pūjā*. (3) \[2199\]

Seventy-three aeons ago  
there were four Naruttamas,[^3]  
wheel-turning monarchs with great strength,  
possessors of the seven gems. (4) \[2200\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (5) \[2201\]

Thus indeed Venerable Tikaṇṇipupphiya Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Tikaṇṇipupphiya Thera is finished.
