### \[86. Raṃsisaññaka (2)\]

On a Himalayan mountain  
I was a bark-clothed \[ascetic\].  
Having ascended the walkway  
I was seated facing the east. (1) \[1531\]

Then having seen the Well-Gone-One,  
Phussa, Lover of Altered States,  
on the mountain, I pressed my hands  
\[and\] pleased \[my\] heart in \[Buddha’s\] rays. (2) \[1532\]

In the ninety-two aeons since  
I obtained that perception \[there\],  
I’ve come to know no bad rebirth:  
that’s the fruit of perceiving rays. (3) \[1533\]

The four analytical modes,  
and these eight deliverances,  
six special knowledges mastered,  
\[I have\] done what the Buddha taught! (4) \[1534\]

Thus indeed Venerable Raṃsisaññaka Thera spoke these verses.

The legend of Raṃsisaññaka Thera is finished.
