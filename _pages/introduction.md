<p class="lead">*Legends of the Buddhist Saints* (*Apadāna*) is a collection of about
six hundred autobiographical poems ascribed to the accomplished Buddhas
and Arahants of the early Buddhist community. Composed in India in the
Pāli language around the second century, <abbr>B.C.E.</abbr>,[^1] the collection has
been preserved for more than two thousand years in Sri Lanka (and later
in Burma,Thailand, Cambodia and Laos) as part of the “Miscellaneous
Division” (*Khuddaka-nikāya*) of the “Basket of Discourses”
(*Sutta-piṭaka*) of the Pāli Buddhist Canon (*Tipiṭaka*). *Apadāna* is
the source of many of the best-loved stories of the saints in the
Buddhist world, which have been transmitted through vernacular
literature and art into the present. It is also a particularly rich and
colorful source for the social and religious history of ancient India.</p>

Each poem narrates the process by which an individual saint came to
attain nirvana (Pāli *nibbāna*), the consummate elimination of suffering
(*dukkha*) through escape from the otherwise endless cycle of birth,
death, rebirth and redeath (*saṃsāra*). Though the final effort —
entailing monastic discipline, study, and meditation to cultivate
Awakening — is always understood to have been made during the saint’s
present/final lifetime, *Apadāna* was one of several texts[^2] preserved
in the “Miscellaneous Division” of the Pāli Canon which explored the
relationship of previous-life karma to present-life experiences and
accomplishments.

Speaking in the first person, each saint recalls[^3] the original pious
deed or “seed” karma (*bīja-kamma*) which he or she performed in a
remote previous lifetime, during the era of a previous Buddha; the
intermediary ripening of that deed during successive rebirths among gods
and men; and its eventual bearing of “fruit” (*phala*) — sainthood —
during the time of Gotama Buddha. The typical *apadāna* is thus a
more-or-less embellished version of a basic tripartite template: “I was
X during the time of previous Buddha Y who lived Z number of aeons ago,
and I performed X seed karma in Y circumstances at that time; because of
that original seed karma, I enjoyed X good rebirths ever since
performing it; as the fullest fruit of that original seed karma, I
attained nirvana during the present lifetime.” Most of the poems
conclude with a standard refrain which reinforces and celebrates the
individual’s final achievement of sainthood (as an Arahant or a Buddha).

The central revelation here, that nirvana is the fruit of good karma
performed during previous lives, was made during a watershed in Buddhist
history. Following the third century, <abbr>B.C.E.</abbr> reign of Aśoka Maurya (Pāli
Asoka Moriya), India’s physical and spiritual landscapes were
transformed by rapid expansion of the Buddhist community. The *Apadāna*
revelation that pious deeds produce future nirvana corresponded to and
helped constitute the order of the day: it presented evidence that
justified the extraordinary expenditure of wealth and effort required
for massive construction projects focused on monasteries and the
distinctively Buddhist reliquary monuments known as stupas, adorned with
fine art; it narrated a readily transportable religious ideology and
cultus that evidently proved compelling as the Buddha’s Teaching and
Discipline (*dhammavinaya*) were carried into new parts of India and
beyond; it explored various types of lay piety, with a special focus on
kingship (and queenship), as lay practitioners began to be included in
conceptualizations of the Buddhist community (Sangha), and as
specifically Buddhist royal ideologies and kingdoms developed.

The attractiveness of this revelation, which provided a master narrative
for living life as a non-renouncer who could nevertheless feel assured
of future nirvana, was augmented by the beauty of the text itself.
Composed entirely in light, sing-song Pāli verse, and originally recited
or even enacted in large festival settings, the text is clearly meant to
be enjoyed for more than its ideological bent. The anonymous authors of
the poems embellished that basic template with all manner of stylistic
ornament (rhyme, rhythm, alliteration, repetition, juxtaposition), with
an extraordinary range of extra-religious content (including botany,
mathematics, medicine, economics, technology, sociology, architecture
and fine art, history and mythology, feminism, statecraft), and with
good doses of humor, pathos, and devotion.

The collection is divided into four unequal sections. The first,
*Buddhāpadāna*, contains a single poem ascribed to Gotama Buddha
himself;[^4] the second, *Paccekabuddhāpadāna*, contains various
verses[^5] ascribed to anonymous “Lonely” Buddhas whom Gotama Buddha
encountered during his own long journey towards nirvana; the third,
*Therāpadāna*, contains about[^6] five hundred and fifty poems ascribed
to early Buddhist monks; the fourth and final section, *Therī-apadāna*,
contains forty poems ascribed to early Buddhist nuns.[^7] In all, the
collection contains nearly eight thousand verses (*gāthā*). The vast
majority of these are composed in variations of the epic *siloka* (Skt.
*śloka*) meter containing four feet of eight syllables each, though the
text is peppered with six-footed verses, as well as four-footed verses
composed in more elaborate meters.

[^2]: These are: *Buddhavaṃsa*, which chronicles the lives of the
    previous Buddhas, of the present Buddha (Gotama), and of the future
    Buddha Metteyya (Maitreya); *Jātaka-gāthā* and *Cariyāpiṭaka*, which
    are early collections of stories of Gotama Buddha’s own previous
    lives; *Vimānavatthu* and *Petavatthu*, which narrate the good and
    bad future births caused by good and bad deeds performed in the
    present life, respectively.

[^3]: One of the virtues of Buddhists and Arahants (and even of advanced
    non-Buddhist religious adepts) is that they can recall their own
    (and others’) previous lives; this truism undergirds the text’s
    claim to authenticity, reinforced in the colophon to each poem which
    stipulates that the foregoing was actually said by the Buddha, monk
    or nun to whom that poem is ascribed. *Paccekabuddhāpadāna* is
    atypical in many ways, one of them being that the verses of the
    individual Lonely Buddhas are recalled and recited by Gotama Buddha,
    rather than by the Lonely Buddhas directly, but the same underlying
    logic is at work here: Gotama Buddha, being Buddha, *can* recall
    what the Lonely Buddhas uttered in the past.

[^4]: A most remarkable second *Buddhāpadāna*, which uniquely describes
    bad karma and its bad results, is tucked away as number 387 {390}
    (“The Rags of Previous Karma”) of the *Therāpadāna*, perhaps because
    it proved very controversial in later Buddhist discourse (on which,
    see my {% cite walters_buddhas-bad-karma --suppress_author %})

[^5]: Most of these verses are lifted from the first (“Rhinoceros Horn”)
    *sutta* of *Sutta-nipāta*, an early collection of Buddhist
    discourses which also has been preserved in the *Khuddaka-nikāya*.

[^6]: The Pali Text Society (<abbr title="Pali Text Society">PTS</abbr>) edition, in Roman script, contains
    five hundred and forty seven poems ascribed to early monks; the
    Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Series edition, in Sinhala script,
    contains five hundred and fifty-nine poems ascribed to early monks.

[^7]: Though the *Therī-apadāna* section is thus considerably shorter
    than the *Therāpadāna*, the collection as a whole enumerates a far
    greater number of nuns than of monks, because several of the
    *Therī-apadāna* poems (\#29-\#32) are collective ones, spoken by
    groups of ten, eighteen or eighty-four thousand nuns at once.
